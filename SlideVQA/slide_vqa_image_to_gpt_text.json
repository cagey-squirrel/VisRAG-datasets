Indian households hold the largest stock of gold in the world.  \n- Two thirds of the Indian demand for gold comes from the rural parts of the country.  \n- In 2012, gold's role as an inflation hedge bolstered its appeal in India. India imported around 850 metric tonne (MT) of gold in 2012.  \n\n- Above ground supply of gold from central bank's sale, reclaimed scrap, and official gold loans.  \n- Hedging interest of producers/miners.  \n- World macroeconomic factors such as the US Dollar, interest rate and economic events.  \n- Commodity-specific events such as the construction of new production facilities or processes, unexpected mine or plant closures, or industry restructuring.  \n- In India, gold demand is also determined to a large extent by its price level and volatility.", "bls1-130817020622-phpapp01_95__basic-life-support-dr-anvita-bhargava-19-1024.jpg": "ABDOMINAL THRUSTS", "astudyoncustomerpreferebceandsatisfactiontowardsbajajbikes-150814133516-lva1-app6891_95__a-study-on-customer-preferebce-and-satisfaction-towards-bajaj-bikes-18-1024.jpg": "Year Author Name Topic Findings  \n2014 Mrs. G.

In this report, we look at how the practices of small business marketers (10-99 employees) in the business-to-business space have changed over the last year. You\u2019ll also find new insights on how content marketing is structured within organizations, how often marketers are publishing new content, initiatives they\u2019re working on, and more.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year of many changes for content marketing. B2B small business marketers are juggling many competing initiatives and are feeling challenged in every area of content marketing. They\u2019re also feeling a bit less effective with content marketing overall. The exceptions are marketers who have a documented content marketing strategy: 60% say they are effective at content marketing and they are less challenged in every area.\n\nIt\u2019s sure to be an interesting year ahead as content marketing continues to become increasingly sophisticated.

It is same as a diode we have discussed earlier, It passes current only when connected in right direction (positive of diode to positive of battery and negative to negative) and do not pass any current when connected in opposite direction, with only difference that when it passes current it also emits light with it.\n\nWarning:\nwhile connecting LED to a battery, the voltage should not exceed to 4.5 volts, if you are using 4 cells = 6volt battery, Add a 100 ohms resistance to bring down voltage. LED are sensitive to voltage and high voltage can damage it permanently. In simple words, never connect a LED directly to power supply.\n\n3. Electrolytic Capacitor\nA capacitor (originally known as condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy in an electric field. When there is a potential difference (voltage) across the conductors, a static electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge to collect on one plate and negative charge on the other plate. In simple words it stores electricity and is polar in nature; the positive terminal of this capacitor should be connected to the positive of battery and the negative. Capacitance is measured in microfarads (\u03bcf) and varies depending on capacitors which tell the maximum volts this capacitor can handle. If you see in the figure right hand side, The capacitor is of 15\u03bcf and can handle a voltage of 400 v.", "asixstepcontentmarketingmodel-120206005134-phpapp01_95__a-six-step-content-marketing-model-13-1024.jpg": "Objective  \nMaintaining relations in a frequent manner  \nContinuous  \nFrequency of new content creation  \nHigh (almost daily)  \nHigh: during the project new content is shared almost continuously  \nIntensity  \nLow  \nAverage  \nMedia pressure  \nLow  \nAverage  \nTarget group  \nMaintaining relations in a frequent manner  \nMid to long-term realisation of objectives  \nMedia choice  \nPrimarily online channels (Facebook, Twitter, blog)  \nPrimarily online channels, supported by suitable offline media  \nType of content  \nFormal and informal \u2018did-you-knows\u2019, news, a glimpse behind the scenes  \nContent in function of project objectives  \nUpdates  \nMid to long-term realisation of objectives  \n1 week to 3 months  \nShort-term realisation of objectives (awareness, sales)  \nProjects  \n1 to 3 months  \nAverage: 1 month  \nCampaigns  \nLow: the same content (advert, games) is used repeatedly throughout the campaign  \nHigh  \nHigh  \nShort-term realisation of objectives (awareness, sales)  \n\nCreating this framework and ensuring the smooth flow of the three different streams is not an exact science.

Multistage sampling technique was employed to determine the sample units representing the national population in the country. In the first stage, a number of districts of Nepal's 75 districts were selected using stratified random sampling to represent the 16 distinct regions defined by Nepal's five development regions and three ecological zones, along with the Kathmandu Valley. In the second stage, simple random sampling technique was used to select proportional numbers of village development committees (VDCs) and municipalities from the sampled districts. In the third stage, wards from the sampled VDCs were selected based on simple random sampling. In the fourth stage, the right-hand rule was employed to select households in each sampled ward. Finally, in the fifth stage, a respondent from each household was selected using Kish grid table i.e., a table of random numbers, to ensure that each eligible member in a selected household has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThe margin of error was +/- 1.8 percent at a 95 percent confidence level at the national level for wave I and +/- 1.5 percent at a 95 percent confidence level at the national level for wave III.

In our organizations?\n\nDouglas McGregor, in his seminal work from 1960, distinguished between two images of human nature, of which only one is \u201dtrue\u201d, in that it holds up to science and available theory. The other one, Theory X, is nothing more than a prejudice that we have about other people. There are two reasons why this theory, besides being a superstition, is commonplace. Firstly, it reflects common thinking from our pre-democratic, pre-enlightenment past. Secondly, while observing other people's behavior, we tend to make conclusions about their human nature \u2013 frequently ignoring behavior-shaping context.\n\nThis matters. Because assumptions we have in our minds about other people shape our behavior, and the way we tend to design and run organizations: if you believe in the existence of Theory X humans, then command-and-control systems design will follow.

Take the examples below from two categories (education and auto insurance), which illustrate a broader cross-industry pattern. In each case, there are lots of category-relevant micro-moments happening in search, yet many brands are missing opportunities to engage because they're not showing up.\n\nThe charts illustrate what we might call \"share of intent\"\u2014or how many times a brand was there as a function of total category searches.\n\nShare of Intent in the Auto Insurance Industry\n\nBrand A 75.2%\nBrand B 28.9%\nBrand C 7.3%\nBrand D 0%\n\nShare of Intent in the Education Industry\n\nBrand A 43.1%\nBrand B 12.1%\nBrand C 0%\nBrand D 0%\n\nIt's worth noting that this missed opportunity\u2014this low share of intent\u2014is happening across devices, but is especially true on mobile. And as consumers continue to shift their behavior, brands are under immense pressure to close these gaps.\n\nWhat happens when you hold the mirror up to your brand? First, grab your mobile device and perform a search in your category. Are you there? Do you like what you see?\n\nNext, work with your agency or team to obtain data on your brand's own \"share of intent\" metrics. Establish a baseline for your category and see how you stack up against your competitors. Identify those micro-moments of interest and intent.\n\nWhen you do this, you are essentially handing over the keys to your brand's future. Nobody wants to miss out on opportunities to your competitors. Nobody wants to be left behind. So, find those moments when you should be present, and dig in your heels.\n\nFIAT drives brand goals by being there for small car searchers\n\nAfter a 28-year hiatus, automaker FIAT returned to the American market, bringing with it the FIAT 500, a small car icon. But after such a long absence, FIAT found it needed to build awareness with a new generation of American consumers. The time was a good one: gas prices were spiraling upwards and Americans' interests in small, efficient city cars was at an all-time high. But getting the word out about the FIAT 500 proved to be difficult as demand for small cars could quickly become stifling.\n\nThe company deployed online and mobile search ads on its category term \"small car\" and they catalyzed interest in those micro-moments of relevance and intent.\n\nIn addition, each ad matched the most of its context. On desktop, FIAT's ads took people to the company's online car configurator. The FIAT 500 was available in a fashionable color combinations, and customizing it was part of the fun. In mobile, the ads pointed people to the nearest dealership, creating a seamless experience for those ready to take their next step.\n\nThe results were tremendous. FIAT saw a 127% increase in branded recall. The FIAT 500 became a huge success in America and even more importantly, the brand was back.\n\nLearn more", "electionsreportmarch2014modiandbjpmaintainsleadcongressovertakesaap-140408123044-phpapp01_95__elections-report-march-2014-modi-and-bjp-maintains-lead-congress-overtakes-aap-8-1024.jpg": "ARVIND KEJRIWAL'S VISIT TO GUJARAT, AAP ASSOCIATED WITH NAXALS\n\nMar #NaxalAAP 7 #AKinGujarat\n\n#AK49 #GharGharModi\n\nDaily mentions of the top 4 politicians in March, 2014\n\nTrending topics on the top politicians\n\nARVIND KEJRIWAL\nAK49 2,72,464\nAKinGujarat 1,46,991\nNaxalAAP 1,12,031\nAKasksModi 59,363\n\nNARENDRA MODI\nGharGharModi 2,63,848\nNaMo 59,186\nMyVoteForModi 1,69,186\nFeku 26,862\n\nRAHUL GANDHI\nAamchaRahul 79,017\nRGinUP 25,114\nBharatKeMazbootHaath 19,824\nMyCongressManifesto 17,399\n\nSimplify 360\u00b0", "2012-02-20fy11roadshow-120221022442-phpapp02_95__feb-20-2012-nestl-2011-fullyear-roadshow-presentation-5-1024.jpg": "Sales  \n83.6 bn  \n\nOrganic Growth  \n+7.5%  \n\nReal Internal Growth  \n+3.9%  \n\nTrading Operating Profit  \n12.5 bn  \n\nTrading Operating Profit Margin  \n15.0%  \n(+60 bps)  \n\nNet Profit  \n9.5 bn  \n(+8.1%)  \n\nNet Profit Margin  \n11.3%  \n(+130 bps)  \n\nUnderlying EPS  \n3.08  \n(+7.8%)  \n\nDividend  \n(proposed)  \n\nAll figures in CHF  \nFebruary 21st, 2012  \n2011 Full Year Results Roadshow  ", "beerindustryfinalslides-110814110012-phpapp01_95__beer-industry-1-1024.jpg": "Beer Industry  \n\u00abBeer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy\u00bb - Benjamin Franklin  \nJon \u00d8yvind Bj\u00f8rnstad  \nChristian Adeler Normann  \nTuesday, 9 August 2011  ", "researchreportonfootballinindia2015-150122112755-conversion-gate01_95__interesting-findings-on-football-in-india-6-1024.jpg": "SSI* Score of Various Leagues\n\nBarclays Premier League 88.9  \nLFP 77.8  \nBundesliga 61.1  \nSerie A", "ch16-150313050025-conversion-gate01_95__chapter-16-creating-highperformance-work-systems-7-1024.jpg": "Principles of HPWS\n\nThe Principle of Shared Information\nA shift away from the mentality of command and control toward one more focused on employee commitment.\nCreating a culture of information sharing where employees are more willing (and able) to work toward the goals for the organization.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2004 South- Western.

In the first seven months of 2008, some 3,800 people died, including 1,500 civilians. Not since the overthrow of the Taliban regime in 2001 have so many died. One reason for this is the return of the Taliban and the strengthening of their position with the help of al-Qaida. Among other things, they have bombarded the national army and international security force with rockets. And the number of suicide bombings has increased from 123 in 2006 to 160 in 2007.\n\n1970\n\n1979 The Soviet Union invades Afghanistan in support of the communist regime. Over one million people die and several million become refugees during the decade-long conflict.\n\n1988\u201389 After UN negotiations, the Soviet Union pulls out of Afghanistan. The Soviet withdrawal begins in February 1989.\n\n1989 Several groups, armed with heavy weapons from the Soviet Union and the USA, lay waste to numerous parts of Kabul. Insurgency takes hold of the city.\n\n1994 The Taliban emerge in southern Afghanistan, gaining support from many who are tired of the war.\n\n1996 The Taliban occupy Kabul, banning everything from popular music to football as a consequence of their deeply-conservative Islamic beliefs.\n\n1980\n\nWomen can no longer work outside their homes and must cover themselves completely, wearing the Burka. Men are forbidden to shave and girls are banned from attending school.\n\n1998 Opposition to the Taliban creates the Northern Alliance and begins guerrilla warfare. Further opposition has followed from Shiite factions, and even Taliban boss Mazar-i-Sharif. Thousands of soldiers from the Taliban regime grow restless, and the USA, which regards Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for bomb attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, as a threat, begins preparations for the Taliban's opposition to bin Laden.\n\n2001 The leader of the Taliban is murdered. Two days later the USA begins bombing Afghanistan in retaliation for the September 11 attacks in New York. The USA and the Northern Alliance take Kabul.\n\n2002 A traditional Afghan assembly is held with 1,600 delegates from all the provinces. The first UN peacekeepers arrive.\n\n2004 A new constitution gives the president strong powers. The president appoints an independent judiciary and establishes the new government. The new constitution also protects religious rights and gives women equal rights. The president is Hamid Karzai. The UN sets up a new security council.\n\n2005 The first parliamentary session is held. The right to vote is extended. The Taliban carries out its first counter-attack.\n\n2006 The Taliban launch rocket attacks against the national army and the international peacekeepers. Suicide bombing attacks increase.\n\n2007 The number of victims of terror attacks reaches 566 per month, up from 425 per month during 2006. More than 40 UN food convoys are attacked and there are more than 130 attacks on humanitarian aid programs. 40 aid workers are killed.\n\n2008 Terror attacks continue. February is the bloodiest month since 2001, with 67 civilians killed and injured in the Arghandab district.

Secondary sources are price sensitive.\n\nGlobal Scenario\n- Silver is predominantly traded on the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and COMEX in New York.\n- LBMA, the global hub of over-the-counter (OTC) trading in silver, is the metal\u2019s main physical market. Comex is a futures and options exchange, where most funds\u2019 activities are focused.\n- Silver is invariably quoted in US Dollars per troy ounce.\n\nIndian Scenario:\n- The average annual demand for silver in India is about 2500 Metric tonnes (MT) per year. In 2011, the country\u2019s production was around 342.13 MT.\n- Nearly 60% of India\u2019s silver demand comes from farmers and rural India, who store their savings in the form of silver bangles and coins.\n\nWorld Markets\n- London Bullion Market is the global hub of OTC (Over-The-Counter) trading in silver.\n- Comdex futures in New York is where most fund activity is focused.", "bearing1-151117114834-lva1-app6892_95__bearing-description-about-basic-types-failure-causes-2-1024.jpg": "BEARINGS\n\nA bearing is a device to permit constrained relative motion between two parts, typically rotation or linear movement.\n\nBearings may be classified broadly according to the motions they allow and according to their principle of operation.", "citizenscience-practiceandpolicy-huji-151214131928_95__citizen-science-theory-practice-policy-workshop-8-1024.jpg": "Citizen Science & Science  \nCitizen Science as Gentlemen/ Gentlewomen science  \nIlliteracy  \nBasic to High-school  \nEarly science (1600\u2019s - early 1800\u2019s)  \nProfessional science (late 1800\u2019s - 1900\u2019s)  \nMary Anning (1799-1847)", "researchreportonfootballinindia2015-150122112755-conversion-gate01_95__interesting-findings-on-football-in-india-7-1024.jpg": "Total PR value from Social Media to Sponsors on association with Indian Super League is USD 1.5 M", "biosensorsinfoodindustry-presentation-150607065755-lva1-app6891_95__biosensors-in-food-industry-presentation-by-sonika-singh-niftem-mtech-first-year-5-1024.jpg": "WORKING AND ELEMENTS OF A BIOSENSOR\n\nElements of a Biosensor\n\nSamples\nCell Cultures\nHuman Samples (Blood, Urine, Saliva)\nFood Samples\nEnvironmental Samples (Air, Water, Soil, Vegetation)\n\nTransducers\na) Bioreceptor(s)\nb) Electrical Interface(s)\n\nElectronic System\nc) Signal Amplifier\nd) Signal Processor\ne) Display\n\nNuc eic Acids\nCells\nAntibodies\nEnzymes\nFET Devices\nNanowire Array\nNanoparticles\nElectrodes", "amethodologyforbuildingtheinternetofthings1-141127194112-conversion-gate01_95__a-methodology-for-building-the-internet-of-things-17-1024.jpg": "IOT OSI in action \u2013 SmartLiving.io implementers Toolbox\n\nEND POINTS\nArduino\nRaspberry Pi\nZWave Devices\nAndroid Makers App\nWeb services\nCustom microcontrollers\nVirtual actuator\nVirtual sensors\nC Lib\nPython Lib\nJS Lib\nGo Lib\nNode.js Lib\nJava Lib\n\nCONNECTIVITY\nTCP/IP\nSERIAL\nZWave\nZigBee\nXBee\n433 Mhz\nIR\n\nMIDDLEWARE\nZWave (IPv6 Gateway)\nRaspberry Pi Makers Gateway\nSmartliving pub sub Broker\n\nIOT SERVICES\nManagement\nTelemetry DB\nRule Engine\n\nAPPS\nWeb app\nWidgets\niOS App\nRule Wizard\n\nSOLUTIONS\n\nDEV TOOLS\nArduino Gateway\nPUBSUB Clients\nAndroid Gateway\nREST Clients\nAutomation Scripting\nWidget Lib\nPolymer Widgets\n\nPlenty of existing resources here", "monetizationslides-150116120943-conversion-gate01_95__monetization-how-the-top-free-apps-make-money-10-1024.jpg": "Worldwide mobile app revenues from 2011 to 2017 (in billion U.S. dollars)\n\nThis statistic presents information on the projected revenues of mobile app stores worldwide from 2011 to 2013 with forecast until 2017.

Motives as personal characteristics are quite stable over time - they describe how important certain goals are for the individual. Preferences, by contrast, can partly evolve during the course of a lifetime - depending on environment, challenges and personal goals. Motives and preferences, combined, influence our interest to acquire certain competencies: There are abilities that are present or that can be learned. Competencies, thus, are directly related to learning.\n\nAs we saw, only behavior is easily and readily observable. It is still quite easy to describe an individual's competencies. With a little more effort, preferences can be mapped and described. Proper identification of someone's motives require even more effort and delicacy.

The thickness of the oil film is related to the mode of lubrication that we will discuss in subsequent slides.\n\nMachine Clearance\n5 \u00b5m\n\nUnder Load, No Motion\n0 \u00b5m\n\nUnder Load and Motion, No Lubricant Present\n0 \u00b5m\n\nUnder Load and Motion, With Lubricant\n1 \u00b5m\n\nDynamic Clearance\n9 \u00b5m\n\nWhen two interacting surfaces in relative motion are separated by a lubricant film, dynamic clearances are not equal to the machine clearances, but depend on load, rotational or linear speed, and oil viscosity.\n\nDIESEL ENGINE COMPONENT OIL FILM THICKNESSES\n\nComponent\nOil Film Thickness (microns)\nRing/Cylinder\n0.3 - 7\nRod Bearings\n0.5 - 2.0\nMain Shaft Bearings\n0.5 - 2.0\nTurbocharger Bearings\n0.5 - 1.5\nPiston Pin Bushing\n0.5 - 1.5\nValve Train\n0 - 1.0\nGearing\n0 - 1.5", "dr-vorapptchapter1emissionsources-121120210508-phpapp02_95__dr-vora-ppt-chapter-1-emission-sources-12-1024.jpg": "India\u2019s Vehicle Population is Accelerating\u2026.\n\nUnits (Millions)\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n2004E\n2009P\n\nHDV\nLCV\nPass Cars\nMotorcycles/Others", "presentation-140726083339-phpapp01_95__global-sustainable-energy-current-trends-and-future-prospects-13-1024.jpg": "Status of Germany with solar power\n\nJune 6th (1pm and 2pm)\n\nJune 9th (National holiday)\n\n24.24 GWh of electricity\n\nGermany produces half of energy with solar\n\nGermany produced a record 50 percent of its electricity needs from solar panels at the start of June, breaking a huge milestone on its march to renewable energy. \n\n7/26/2014  \nhttp://www.thelocal.de/20140619/germany-produces-half-of-electricity-needs-with-solar-power", "clef2015-150909194741-lva1-app6892_95__evaluating-the-search-experience-from-retrieval-effectiveness-to-user-engagement-12-1024.jpg": "User variability\n\nTask complexity\n\nRemember\n\nProportion of cases\n\nEstimate of T\n\nUnderstand\n\nProportion of cases\n\nEstimate of T\n\nAnalyze\n\nProportion of cases\n\nEstimate of T\n\nT: number of documents users (judges) expected to read\n\nQ: number of queries users (judges) expected to issue\n\n(Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001; Bailey et al, 2015)\n\nYAHOO!", "brandmanagement-itchotels-150823162717-lva1-app6892_95__brand-management-itc-hotels-6-1024.jpg": "ITC\u2019s growth over the years\n\nITC has added 8,000 rooms in the last 2 years\n\nRevenue (INR Mn)", "erpmodule-120905074920-phpapp02_95__erp-module-finance-13-1024.jpg": "EXAMPLE OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING\n\nSale Register\n\nVoucher No.: 1  \nCustomer Code: 301  \nCustomer Name: Alvin William  \nAddress: P O Box 5151 Welvereden Park  \n\nS No  Item Code  Item Description  Qty  Rate  Amount (a)  \nD11  D.Jing  3.00  1320.00  3960.00  \nD2   TL Audio C-1  1.00  250.00  250.00  \nD7   JBL T-45  6.00  357.00  2142.00  \nE1   Flip Chip  4.00  1090.00  4360.00  \nE5   PreSonus  4.00  200.00  800.00  \nD8   Phoxtex PH-5  4.00  200.00  800.00  \nE10  Plextor PX-01  3.00  500.00  1500.00  \n\nTotal: 18812.00  \nQty: 33  \n\nTax Type: Central Sales Tax  \nPer: 50.00  \nNature: Percentage  \nAmount: 940.60  \n\nGrand Total: 19752.60  \n\nMemo: Order placed by: Oliver.  \n\n[Add] [Save] [Cancel] [Delete] [Print] [Exit]", "fintechver8-thejunction-130112110154-phpapp02_95__the-future-of-online-commerce-and-the-digital-wallet-2-1024.jpg": "THE TIMELINE OF MONEY\n\nBEFORE 600BC\nBARTERING\nLivestock, Tools & Food\n\n600BC - PRESENT\nCOINS\n\nc. 806 - PRESENT\nPAPER MONEY\n\n321BC - PRESENT\nCHECKS\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\nmPAYMENTS & VIRTUAL CURRENCY\n\nDISRUPTION IS COMING\nEXPANDING ROLES AND THE BLURRING OF BOUNDARIES", "assessmentoffetalwellbeinginpregnancyandlabour-jaipur-150303105805-conversion-gate01_95__assessment-of-fetal-wellbeing-in-pregnancy-and-labour-13-1024.jpg": "Parameter  \nBaseline  \n110\u2013160 bpm  \n100\u2013110 bpm  \n> 160 bpm  \nRising baseline  \n\nVariability  \n6\u201325 bpm (moderate)  \n\u2264 5 (absent or minimal) for < 40 min.  \n\u2264 5 for \u2265 80 min.  \n\u2265 25 bpm > 10 min.  \n\nDecelerations  \nNone or occasional variable < 30 sec.  \nVariable decelerations 30\u201360 sec. duration  \nVariable decelerations \u2265 60 sec. duration  \nLate deceleration(s)  \n\nAccelerations  \n\u2265 2 accelerations with acme of \u2265 15 bpm, lasting 15 sec. < 40 min. of testing  \n\u2264 2 accelerations with acme of \u2265 15 bpm, lasting 15 sec. in 40\u201380 min.  \n\u2264 2 accelerations of \u2265 10 bpm, lasting 10 sec. in > 80 min.  \n\nTerm Fetus  \nPreterm Fetus (< 32 weeks)  \n\u2265 2 accelerations with acme of \u2265 10 bpm, lasting 10 sec. < 40 min. of testing  \n\u2264 2 accelerations of \u2265 10 bpm, lasting 10 sec. in 40\u201380 min.  \n\nACTION  \nFURTHER ASSESSMENT OPTIONAL  \nbased on total clinical picture  \nFURTHER ASSESSMENT REQUIRED  \nURGENT ACTION REQUIRED  \nAn overall assessment of the situation and further investigation with US or BPP is required.
