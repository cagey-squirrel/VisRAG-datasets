Perhaps that\u2019s why so many people fake it. According to Italian security researchers Andrea Stroppa and Carlo De Micheli, the black market for phony Twitter accounts could be up to $360 million a year. Though most sellers operate behind the scenes, buyers can snap up cheap follower-bots\u2014software that imitates a real Twitter user\u2014on eBay and a few legit-feeding websites. Or they can tap the growing group of real people who sell follows. In this graphic, sellers cluster at the top of the page. Buyers are at the bottom.  \n\nWHOLESALERS  \nIN DARK CORNERS OF THE INTERNET, THEY PLY TOOLS TO OVERRIDE TWITTER\u2019S RULES  \nThe nonsensical word you\u2019re asked to type in to gain access to a site can double as a password, the site can also provide you with 1,000 Captchas.  \n\n$15-$1,152 a month for bulk IP addresses from India/MAS.com, so accounts appear to be from legitimate locations.  \n$50 buy your own domain and email addresses for $5 from BulkAccount.net.  \n\nSELLERS  \nTHEY PREFER TO BE CALLED MARKETING EXPERTS  \nMany are legitimate-seeming companies with slick websites. Using the wholesalers\u2019 tools, they sell in bulk hawking fake followers by the thousands. Sellers earn $2 to $30 for each account, depending on sophistication.  \n\nSECOND-TIER PLAYERS  \nSMALL FIRMS RELY ON BIG SELLERS\u2019 TOOLS  \nBig sellers not only hawk follower accounts but also sell software to smaller follower-creating firms. A software license costs $999 to $5,000, depending on the level of account customization, and includes free updates and support for one year.  \n\nFAKE-FOLLOWER MAGNETS  \nBIG TWITTER PRESENCE?

It set off a chain of events that 37 days later would cause The Great Powers to start the four-year bloody conflict called the First World War. It was a war in which Canada forged itself as a nation, but at a terrible cost. Almost 420,000 men were sent overseas \u2013 60,000 died and 172,000 were wounded. And from the first to the last, Canada found itself in the thick of action.

Apple has started repositioning its iOS devices, which offer creations and educational games, as the company has found that iPads are easier for kids to use. iPads rank among the hands of American students, offering them learning apps and digital textbooks. Baby Tech Nearly half of first-time mobile tech users aren't even in kindergarten yet. Check out the percentage of children who have used a device, such as an iPad or a video game. Age 0-1: 10% 2-4: 39% 5-8: 52% Tablet Families 7 out of 10 children are using tablets. 10 of those children are using a tablet, such as an iPad. Children aged 6 to 12 wanted apple products most for Christmas 2011: iPad 40% iPod touch 25% iPhone 25% Tablet Computer (non-iPad) 9% Computer 1% Mobile Tech in Education Within the first 45 days of iPad sales, 47,000 were sold to schools in the United States. 1.5 million iPads American students currently use 1.5 million iPads. As mobile technology in education is expected to increase significantly and become more of a standard. 20,000 learning apps There are currently more than 20,000 educational learning apps available for iPads. 80% of apps More than 80 percent of the best-selling paid apps in the iTunes Store's education category targeted children. Textbooks In 2012, Apple unveiled a new version of its iBooks digital bookstore to support textbooks. Below is the percentage of digital textbooks on the market. 2011: 6% 2012: 20% 2020: 50%+ is used by more than 1,000 colleges worldwide. Offers more than 500,000 pieces of audio and video material. 700 million downloads. iPad students outperform non-iPad students. A 2012 study tested a group of kindergarteners before deep engagement. After 9 weeks, the students with iPads outperformed the non-iPad students in every literacy measure. Teachers are learning that iPads can match the needs of special education students. A study by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center saw an average 27 percent increase in vocabulary among 5-year-olds after using an educational iPad app. A similar study showed a 17 percent improvement among 3-year-olds. Making Special-Needs Education Easier In 2012, Apple announced a \"guided access\" feature for iOS that would allow parents or teachers to keep children locked in individual apps. It could help \"someone with a disability\" focus. As of July 2012, there were more than 900 autism-related apps available for the iPad. Before the iPad, devices dedicated to special-needs education could cost up to $15,000. Speech Language Reading Writing and spelling Organization and note-taking Listening skills Communication David Niemeijer, creator of the first alternative augmentative communication (AAC) app, says 90 percent of AAC users use an iPad for communication. Over 25 percent of users used an iPhone or iPod touch. Half of AAC users reported improved speech outcomes. Although iPads aren't the most integral tool for a child's education quite yet, Americans can expect that to change in the next decade.

If so, congratulations! You have DNA! That microscopic little building block of life that makes us all the same, but grants us with distinct differences. But for someone as busy as you, it can be a lot to digest. Here are the facts to help you better understand the little bit of genetic coding that makes you, you!\n\nDNA STANDS FOR DeoxyriboNucleic Acid.\n\nDNA IS FOUND IN ALL LIVING THINGS.\n\nDNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher, who in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages that he called \"nuclein.\"\n\nDNA has a double-helix structure like a twisted ladder. The sides of the DNA ladder are made of sugars and phosphate molecules.\n\nADENINE (A) IS A BASE. THYMINE (T) IS A BASE. CYTOSINE (C) IS A BASE. GUANINE (G) IS A BASE.\n\n1 MILLION BASES (A.K.A.

This can be due to stress, financial issues, or other factors. The victim may feel like they are walking on eggshells.\n\nINCIDENT\n\nBut if the tension is not resolved, it can lead to an incident of abuse. This can be physical, emotional, or psychological.\n\nRECONCILIATION\n\nAfter an incident, there may be a period of reconciliation. The abuser may apologize, promise to change, or blame the victim for the incident.\n\nCALM\n\nThis stage can lead to a false sense of security. The victim may believe that the abuser has changed, but the cycle often repeats itself.\n\nTHE CYCLE ENDS WITH YOU\n\nThe most crucial step is to recognize it. Follow these practical steps to break the cycle:\n\nTell someone about your experiences\n\nSafely challenge the behavior\n\nConsider the Aurora App\n\nLead by example and tell your community to be allies of others\n\nKNOW YOUR RIGHTS\u2014SEEK LEGAL ACTION\n\nCIL Lawyers is a Sydney-based law firm providing a family law service.

Before a watchful world, each side sought to demonstrate its superiority through impressive feats in rocketry and spaceflight. Secret satellites kept a wary eye on the adversary.\n\nAt the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia agreed to build a space station and pursue cooperation that has become a partnership.\n\nSome famous space race probes and missions include Sputnik 1, Explorer 1, Vostok 1, Mariner 2, Ranger 7, Luna 9, Apollo 8, and Apollo 11.\n\n27 August 1962\nMariner 2\nThis was the first probe to conduct a successful flyby of another planet, sending Venus data back to Earth.\n\n12 April 1961\nVostok 1\nFirst manned spaceflight in history. Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human to enter outer space and completes a single orbit of the Earth.\n\n5 May 1961\nFreedom 7\nFirst manned space mission of the United States. Astronaut Alan Shepard pilots a Project Mercury capsule in a 15-minute suborbital flight.\n\n31 January 1958\nExplorer 1\nFirst artificial satellite launched by the United States into space to orbit Earth. It discovered the Van Allen radiation belt.\n\n4 October 1957\nSputnik 1\nFirst artificial satellite to be put into Earth's orbit. This launch by the Soviet Union ignited the Space Race.

IMPACT OF THE VIRUS\nThe impact of the virus appears to vary from country to country. Better understanding of why will reveal more about the challenge we face. These differences are influenced by:\n- Individual countries' demographics\n- Intensive care capacity\n- Incidence of prior medical conditions\n\n2. THE SITUATION IN ASIA\nIt\u2019s too early to say whether the war has been won in the East. We are monitoring whether:\n- The virus flares up again once social distancing is eased\n- Asia can resume some normality without a renewed outbreak\n- If successful, Asia\u2019s action sets a template for others\n\n3. TEST, TEST, TEST\nMass testing is essential for governments to implement a South Korean style response. \n- To see who has the virus\n- To see who has had the virus and thus may have immunity\n- So new cases can be identified fast, clusters spotted and targeted quarantine re-imposed\n\n4. ANTIVIRALS AND VACCINES\nThe speed at which treatments become available is the most important signpost we are tracking:\n- Progress on vaccines and antivirals\n- Whether additional resources can speed development\n- Whether rules are relaxed on trialing prototypes\n\n5. LEARNING TO LIVE WITH COVID-19\nWe\u2019re watching to see whether the following might help society adjust to this new world:\n- Acquired immunity allowing a return to semblance of normality\n- Mass testing\n- Better hygiene standards\n\nUsing this framework, we believe we\u2019ll be able to better understand the direction of the virus and make better-informed investment decisions.\n\nFor our latest views, read our Coronavirus updates.\n\nThis infographic is issued by BNP PARIBAS ASSET MANAGEMENT Holding, a Public Limited Company with its registered office at 1, boulevard Haussmann, 75009 Paris, France, RCS Paris 682 020 901.

For the protection of their health, people with diabetes are currently being encouraged to stay at home.\n\nDuring this time of uncertainty, it is vital to stay physically active and regularly break up your sitting time. Here we highlight the benefits of remaining active, alongside some tips on how to do so whilst at home.\n\nBenefits of keeping active\n\nPhysical wellbeing\nMaintaining diabetes control\nSitting and over-eating (common behaviours when told to stay at home) allow sugar to build up in the blood stream.\n\nWeight management\nDuring self-isolation, sitting down more while maintaining normal eating habits is likely to cause weight gain. Reducing the amount of time you spend sitting throughout the day can combat this, as engaging in all activities raises your heart rate. Regular engagement in physical activity can also encourage feelings of fullness after eating, helping you regulate your appetite better.\n\nHealthier immune system\nEngaging in regular physical activity and exercise improves your body\u2019s ability to fight illnesses helping keep you healthy.\n\nMental wellbeing\nReducing stress and anxiety\nUncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation can increase the risk of stress, anxiety, and depression (in short, not feeling yourself). Engaging in physical activity is a great way to release endorphins, which are often referred to as \u201chappy hormones\u201d.\n\nSleep regulation\nBeing physically active requires you to expend energy, and helps you feel more tired and ready to rest at the end of the day (more so than a day spent sitting). \n\nConsequently, reduced anxiety from physical activity can also allow for a more restful night\u2019s sleep.\n\nRestoring routine\nSuddenly being told to remain inside at home has disrupted the lifestyles of millions worldwide. Creating an exercise schedule will assist in bringing structure and routine back to daily life.\n\nIdeas to keep active and break up sitting while at home\n(Improvisation is key)\n\nBreaking up sitting time (every little helps)*\nAim to break up your sitting once every 30 minutes for a few minutes by:\n- Getting up during TV ads to walk around your home/short household chores or move the remote away from your chair\n- Trying to stand and potter around for a while following meals\n- Standing up during phone calls or when checking social media\n- Set a reminder on your phone to get up every 30 minutes \u2013 you could walk up and down your stairs several times (if you have some)\n- After reading 20 pages of a book stand up and stretch\n- Put your laptop or tablet or newspaper on a high surface to stand and read\n- If you spend a lot of time on a computer/laptop why not download something to prompt you to break up both screen time and sitting time e.g., http://outstandingapp.github.io/\n\nAerobic activity (to raise your heart rate further)\n- March briskly on the spot or walk around the house/up and down the stairs for at least 5 minutes several times per day\n- Dancing to your favourite music\n- Gardening\n- Doing an online exercise session.\n- Skipping.\n\nStrengthening (to challenge your muscles)**\n- Squats or sit-to-stands from a sturdy chair.\n- Single leg steps on the stairs.\n- Whilst standing do glute clenches (tense your buttocks).\n- Do calf raises (to go up on your toes) whilst waiting for the kettle to boil.\n- Press-ups against a wall, a kitchen counter or on the floor.\n- Use household items if you have them (if not, beans or bottles would work just as well).\n\nSafety and practical considerations while keeping active at home\n\nExercising with COVID-19 symptoms\nIf you develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath (beyond that caused naturally through physical activity) you should discontinue and reach out to a health care provider.\n\nExercising with Diabetes complications (Tailoring exercise to those with weight bearing difficulty)\nAll weight-bearing activity should be avoided in those with diabetic foot ulcers to facilitate ulcer healing, whilst extra care is needed with peripheral nerve damage to detect and prevent foot problems from occurring.\n\nExercising or breaking up \u201crestful\u201d sitting time with upper body movement can be equally valuable. Further ideas on chair and bed based exercises can be found in the useful links section accompanying this information. You may want to try using resistance bands or improvising with food cans as weights.\n\nInsulin and exercise\nExercise improves the efficiency of insulin, meaning that your previous insulin dosage may now be too high. With too much insulin, this can increase the risk of potentially dangerous drops in blood sugar called \u201chypoglycaemic episodes\u201d.\n\nTo limit this occurrence, we encourage those taking insulin to avoid exercise if their blood sugar is less than 5mmol/L beforehand.\n\n*If working from home, we would encourage you to sign up to our free SMART work programme where you will have access to a range of tools and ideas on how to reduce sedentary behaviour while working from home. Many of these resources will be useful in your new role as a home worker. \n\nThe Moving Medicine resource also has a number of booklets which can be downloaded to support you in your physical activity journey. \n\nMore guidance upon Diabetes and Exercise alongside updates in COVID-19 advice to those with diabetes can be found through the Diabetes UK website. \n\nLeicester Diabetes Centre", "33897.jpeg": "NEW TRAFFIC RULES, FINES\n\nSpeeding (over limit)\n80 km/h Dh3,000 23 black points Confiscation 60 days\n60 km/h Dh2,000 12 black points Confiscation 30 days\n\nSpeeding (by not more than)\n60 km/h Dh1,500 Confiscation 15 days\n50 km/h Dh1,000\n40 km/h Dh500\n30 km/h Dh300\n\nDriving a vehicle without number plates Dh3,000 23 black points Confiscation 90 days\n\nDriving under the influence of alcohol Dh20,000 23 black points Confiscation 60 days\n\nOvertaking on the hard shoulder Dh1,000 6 black points\n\nJumping a red light Dh1,000 12 black points Confiscation 30 days\n\nCarrying and transporting passengers illegally Dh2,000 12 black points Confiscation 30 days\n\nBlocking traffic Dh1,000\n\nDriving a noisy vehicle Dh2,000 6 black points\n\nMotorists distracted by mobile phones (or any other distraction offences) Dh800 4 black points\n\nDriving under the influence of drugs or similar substances Decided by court 23 black points Confiscation 60 days\n\nSudden swerve Dh1,000\n\nExceeding permitted level of car window tinting Dh1,500\n\nDriving dangerously Dh2,000 Confiscation 60 days\n\nFailure to wear seat belt while driving Dh400\n\nNot renewing vehicle registration Dh500 Confiscation 7 days\n\nAllowing children under 10 years old to sit in the front seat Dh400\n\n*If it has expired for over 3 months*", "30341.jpeg": "YOUR HEALTH IN ONE DROP\n\nHealthcare is confusing. It makes managing your health hard. With changing health plans, multiple & disconnected practitioners, and wanting to focus on prevention, we need to take responsibility for our own health.\n\nTHE POWER OF BLOOD DIAGNOSTICS\n\n70% of data needed for accurate diagnosis and health management is in your blood. This data is critical for wellness and prevention, not just treating disease.\n\nGOOD NEWS: Your blood cells regenerate every 120 days, so you can quickly measure significant improvement from lifestyle and nutritional changes.\n\nApproximately 41% of the people who experience a heart attack will die from it.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH\n\nFor 150,000 people each year, the first symptom of heart disease is death.\n\nBlood diagnostic testing can provide greater knowledge about the risks for heart disease and other chronic illnesses by giving better insight into the following areas:\n\nCHOLESTEROL\n\nNot all cholesterol is dangerous. Some types, like High-Density Cholesterol, can actually help clear your blood vessels.\n\nHDL (\"GOOD\") CHOLESTEROL\nFOODS THAT PROMOTE HDL PRODUCTION:\nOatmeal, Fish, Nuts\n\nLDL (\"BAD\") CHOLESTEROL\nELEVATED BY:\nCheese, Fried Foods, High Glycemic Foods\n\nHOWEVER, WE NEED TO LOOK BEYOND HDL/LDL LEVELS.\n\n50% of heart attack patients have normal HDL and LDL levels. Measuring your LDL sub-particles such as Apo B and Lp(a) gives you a more accurate assessment of your risks.\n\nTRIGLYCERIDES\n\nA form of fat in the body linked with heart disease and diabetes.\n\nACQUIRED BECAUSE OF:\nObesity, Cigarette Smoking, High-Carb Diet, Alcohol\n\nApo-B, which is not part of a standard cholesterol test, is responsible for linking bad cholesterol to blood vessels, and high levels can be a better predictor of risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\nINFLAMMATION\n\nA major contributor to many chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and dementia is inflammation. Recent studies have even shown that inflammation negatively impacts exercise capacity. This can be measured in your blood by the High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) marker.\n\nANTI-INFLAMMATORY FOODS:\nSalmon, Blueberries, Oranges, Green Tea, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Papayas, Sweet Potatoes, Broccoli\n\nTHYROID\n\nMore than 1 in 10 Americans have Thyroid Disease, commonly causing fatigue and weight gain. Most are undiagnosed.\n\nHypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid produces too little thyroid hormone, causing the body to burn energy slower, can:\n- Cause weight gain and increase risk for heart disease.\n- Increase cold intolerance and fatigue.\n- Increase cholesterol levels due to inhibition of the body's ability to metabolize energy.\n\nVITAMIN D\n\nBecause we are not outdoors and don\u2019t get as much sun as our ancestors, more than 75% of US adults have insufficient levels of Vitamin D. This has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and infection.\n\nTaking fish oil also aids in Vitamin D production.\n\nEveryone has a different optimal level of Vitamin D; testing gives insight into how to achieve yours.\n\nSMART BLOOD TEST\n\nRegular blood diagnostics can help you keep track of your overall health in a more meaningful way, and more importantly, identify potential health threats that standard testing may not find.\n\nCONTROL OF DATA\n\nHaving a wellness team review your results and offer holistic guidelines on how to improve your health ensures you aren\u2019t just healthy today, but you are optimized for the future.\n\nWELLNESSFX\n\nSOURCES: thevapest.com | nih.gov | rightdiagnosis.com | heart.org | johnshopkinshealthalerts.com | advamed.org", "32567.jpeg": "Quarantine Grocery Checklist\n\nProduce\n- Carrots\n- Cabbage\n- Apples\n- Lemon\n- Tomatoes\n- Grapes\n\nMeat\n- Chicken Breasts\n- Fish Fillets\n- Ground Beef\n- Pork Chop\n- Drumsticks\n- Hotdogs\n\nCanned\n- Pasta Sauce\n- Honey\n- Beans\n- Sardines\n- Canned Soup\n- Meatloaf\n\nFrozen\n- Ice Cream\n- Juice\n- Microwave Meals\n- Fruits\n- Chocolate\n\nCondiments\n- Ketchup\n- Mustard\n- Mayo\n- Hot Sauce\n- Soy Sauce\n- Vinegar\n\nRefrigerated\n- Carrots\n- Cabbage\n- Apples\n- Cream\n- Cheese\n- Soda\n\nSpecial notes on your quarantine grocery list here.

If these tasks are outside of your team\u2019s wheelhouse, what doesn\u2019t mean shrink is out of reach, reputable pre-press shops have the knowledge to become a strong and supportive industry partner in your shrink endeavor.\n\nIN-HOUSE DESIGN: ESKO STUDIO\nThe 3D software gives users the ability to create art specific to container shapes so design can be applied to the shape with accurate visualization. Developed to support pre-press operators and packaging designers, Studio is a time-efficient and creative alternative to grid tests.\n\nDESIGNING ART SUITED FOR DISTORTION\nAfter receiving an art file from a brand owner, the next step is to properly distort the file to ensure proper distortion when heat is applied to the shrink sleeve label.\n\nIN-HOUSE DISTORTION: GRID TESTS\nThere\u2019s no one size fits all when distorting files for shrink. Traditionally, grid tests are used by printing a grid pattern inside the product art template, running production, then manually noting creases and crevices on containers to compare to the layout, identifying exits to assure application success. It\u2019s a tried and true process but is quite time-consuming.\n\nRECIPE FOR SUCCESS\nIt may take some trial and error, but it\u2019s a necessary evil to curate the perfect combination of ink, primer and substrate to provide the highest quality product. Having the right consumables experts can alleviate much of the pain associated with creating that secret recipe by eliminating much of that trial and error with their industry knowledge and ability to capitalize on wide network for testing purposes.\n\nWORKFLOW #2 PRINT\n\nPRINTING NARROW WEB SHRINK WITH THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY\nWhether you\u2019re looking for the capability to utilize a pressure sensitive label with flexo or the opportunity to maximize a digital hybrid inkjet investment by leveraging offerings to include shrink, the demand for the application is growing.\n\nWORKFLOW #3 FINISHING\n\nSLEEVE APPLICATION SEAMING\nFrom properly designing lay flat art to support seaming to utilizing the best compatible solvent for the material used to selecting the equipment that best suits your seaming needs, seaming is a complex process, nearing the end of the workflow with many variables at hand.\n\nRETROFITTING CURRENT TECHNOLOGY FOR SHRINK\nIt\u2019s not always necessary or realistic to make a huge capital investment to produce shrink sleeves. Your existing press may need simple upgrades to provide a path to shrink application, such as adding a chill drum at the drying stations or utilizing LED curing.\n\nTHE FINAL STEP HEAT APPLICATION\nWhile there are many different ways to apply heat to a seamed shrink sleeve, the best results steam from the uniform spread of temperature. This is most often achieved via a third-party packaging partner with equipment that provides evenly-distributed heat via hot air tunnel, steam tunnel or some hybrid technology.", "31539.jpeg": "IRELAND ICT CORE SKILLS AUDIT  \nKEY STRENGTHS OF IRELAND\u2019S ICT POPULATION  \nENTRY LEVEL  \n- Programming and development methodologies  \n- Web technologies and development platforms  \n- eLearning/Digital Marketing  \n- Call center/Help desk support  \n- Digital skills/media  \n\nCOMPETENT LEVEL  \n- Software development tools and methodologies  \n- Cloud computing  \n- Platform administration  \n\nEXPERT LEVEL  \n- Cybersecurity and digital forensics  \n- Network technologies  \n- Big data  \n- Enterprise applications  \n\nIRELAND ICT CORE SKILLS AUDIT  \nPROJECT MANAGEMENT  \nENTRY LEVEL 46%  \nCOMPETENT LEVEL 10%  \nEXPERT LEVEL 44%  \n\nPROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT  \nENTRY LEVEL 60%  \nCOMPETENT LEVEL 4%  \nEXPERT LEVEL 36%  \n\nSTRONG SKILLS DEMAND ACROSS ALL ICT DISCIPLINES  \nCloud Computing 15%  \nData Analysis 14%  \nProgramming 11%  \nCybersecurity 9%  \nEnterprise Software 9%  \nWeb Dev 8%  \nIT Ops 7%  \nCall Centre 5%  \nBig Data 4%  \nMobile Dev 4%  \nDigital Skills 1%  \n\nPROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS  \nENTRY LEVEL 60%  \nCOMPETENT LEVEL 4%  \nEXPERT LEVEL 36%  \n\nCritical thinking skills 46%  \nTechnical report writing 44%  \nRoot cause analysis 38%  \nInventive thinking skills 54%  \n\nDesigned by Easelly, a simple infographic maker tool that lets you visualize any kind of information  \neaselly https://www.easel.ly/", "33088.jpeg": "Moses Mabhida Stadium  \nCapacity: 70,000  \nCost: $442.5m  \nLocation: Durban  \nBuilding started: 2007  \nCompleted in: 2009  \n\nCape Town Stadium  \nCapacity: 68,000  \nCost: $677.4m  \nLocation: Cape Town  \nBuilding started: 2007  \nCompleted in: 2009  \n\nNelson Mandela Bay  \nCapacity: 46,000  \nCost: $220m  \nLocation: Port Elizabeth  \nBuilding started: 2007  \nCompleted in: 2009  \n\nPeter Mokaba  \nCapacity: 46,000  \nCost: $300m  \nLocation: Polokwane  \nOpened 2010  \n\nMbombela  \nCapacity: 43,000  \nCost: $1.1m  \nLocation: Rustenburg  \nCompleted 2009  \n\nTotal cost of all stadium infrastructure: US $1.12bn (R19.5 bn)", "33527.jpeg": "PULP FICTION\n\n1994\n154 MINUTES\nTHRILLER, CRIME, DRAMA\n\nDIRECTOR:\nQUENTIN TARANTINO\nQUENTIN TARANTINO/ROGER AVARY\n\nWRITERS:\nQUENTIN TARANTINO\nROGER AVARY\n\nCAST:\nSAMUEL L.

During this time, authorities could be overthrown, and many forms of Roman law were ignored.\n- The establishment of Christmas as a holiday was a frantic attempt to convert large amounts of people to Christianity.

Without walls or cubicles, employees interact with each other frequently.\n20% of U.S. workers prefer this setup.\nWho should work here?\nWorkers who enjoy collaboration and open communication.\n\nThe Cellular Office\nThis traditional workspace is divided into individual offices, typically with doors for added privacy. Offices may be smaller than one room.\n26% of U.S. workers prefer this setup.\nWho should work here?\nWorkers who value privacy and need to concentrate.\n\nThe Cubicle Setup\nBetween the open office design and the cellular offices is the cubicle setup, which divides an open space into semi-private areas using medium to high walls.\n#2 is the average cubicle size, which is the size of a small room.\nWho should work here?\nWorkers who desire some privacy but still want to be part of a team.\n\nTelecommuting\nThanks to advances in communication technologies, this increasingly popular work setup allows employees to work remotely either full- or part-time.\n50% of U.S. workers do this at least part-time.\nWho should work here?\nWorkers who enjoy flexibility and independence.\n\nCoworking Space\nCoworking spaces are shared office environments where remote workers can rent a workspace with access to printers, scanners, and meeting space.\n2x the number of coworking spaces worldwide doubles each year.\nWho should work here?\nWorkers who thrive in a collaborative environment.\n\nWhat's Next?\nOne size certainly does not fit all when it comes to workplace design. Progressive companies are experimenting with hot-desking, co-working, and hybrid models. Google has even adopted the idea of a hybrid workplace that features a variety of spaces to suit various personalities and situations.\n\nImprove your workplace.\nLove your job, but not your workplace?

How do they compare and what are their uses? Find out now!  \n\nCMYK  \nCMYK is the standard color profile for printing. Typically, CMYK colors do not appear as bright as RGB (they're used together, a rich black is produced).  \n\nRGB  \nRGB is the color profile used for digital screens and devices. Red, Green, and Blue screen mixes red, green, and blue light together to produce colors.  \n\nPANTONE  \nThe Pantone Matching System (PMS) is used to accurately reproduce colors for branding and other printed materials.  \n\nWhat about Printing?  \n\nSPOT COLOR (OFFSET)  \nSpot color printing describes the process where a specific color is created using a pre-mixed ink.  \n\nBEST FOR:  \nSpot color printing is typically used for jobs which require full color, such as business cards or stationery, or in monochrome for brochures and literature such as black and white newspaper print.  \n\nFOUR COLOR (OFFSET)  \nFour color process refers to the CMYK printing method, using only Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black ink colors.  \n\nBEST FOR:  \nFour color process is the most common form of printing and is best for large batches, like 500 postcards. It produces clear shapes.  \n\nDIGITAL PRINTING  \nDigital printing uses either toner or ink-jet technology. Digital printing might still use CMYK, but all colors are created with the \"offset\" roller method.  \n\nBEST FOR:  \nDigital printing is recommended for small batches, like 20 invitations or just one poster.  \n\nThe Logo Co  \nEnjoying Beauty & Style for Higher Heights.", "20087.jpeg": "AFTERMATH OF THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE\n\nThousands of Lives Devastated\nESTIMATED DEATHS 200,000\nINJURIES 196,595\nHOMELESS 1,100,000\nNEED FOOD 2,000,000\nHARDEST HIT POPULATION 3,725,615\nTOTAL POPULATION IN HAITI 10,000,000\n\nEstimated Age of the Hardest Hit Population\nAGES 0-9 25.7% 958,109\nAGES 10-19 23.8% 889,126\nAGES 20-39 30.4% 1,134,945\nAGES 40-59 15% 555,501\nAGES 60+ 5.1% 187,932\nHARDEST HIT POPULATION 3,725,615\n50% < 20 years old\n\nAlready the Poorest Country in the Western Hemisphere\nPEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY 80%\nHAITI GDP (USD) $6.95 Billion\n\nRelief Efforts\nTOTAL HUMANITARIAN FUNDING (USD) $1.55 Billion\nTOTAL HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE $2.35 Billion\n$800 Million Uncommitted Pledges\n\nNOTE\nFUNDING = CONTRIBUTIONS + COMMITMENTS\nCommitment: creation of a legal, contractual obligation between the donor and recipient, entirely specific.\nContribution: the actual payment of funds or transfer of in-kind goods; the donor is not obligated to fulfill the commitment in its entirety. \nPledge: an expression of intent to make a donation or an intended contribution or allocation by the donor. \n\nSOURCES: World Bank, Relief Web, OCHA, UNFPA for World Population 2009.", "11339.jpeg": "Unknown: 52  \nConfirmed cases: 83 890  \nTests conducted: 1 228 098  \nDeaths: 1 737  \nRecoveries: 44 920  \n\nProvince:  \nEastern Cape: Deaths 257, Recoveries 6 331  \nFree State: Deaths 9, Recoveries 235  \nGauteng: Deaths 87, Recoveries 3 756  \nKwaZulu-Natal: Deaths 73, Recoveries 2 133  \nLimpopo: Deaths 4, Recoveries 229  \nMpumalanga: Deaths 1, Recoveries 156  \nNorth West: Deaths 5, Recoveries 175  \nNorthern Cape: Deaths 1, Recoveries 81  \nWestern Cape: Deaths 1 300, Recoveries 31 824  \n\nDate: 18-06-2020  ", "20313.jpeg": "COST OF THE AVERAGE WOMAN'S OUTFIT  \n$1,321.28  \n$552 Jewelry  \n$73 Top  \n$27 Knitwear  \n$32 Coat  \n$112 Watch  \n$155 Handbag  \n$39 Underwear  \n$44 Skirt  \n$75 Shoes  \n\nIN A LIFETIME, WOMEN SPEND  \n$125,000 on clothing and accessories  \n$15,000 on beauty products  \n$3,770 on mascara  \n\nMEET THE STYLE-CONSCIOUS WOMAN  \nAlthough she only represents 40% of the population, the style-conscious woman accounts for 70% of total apparel, accessory, and beauty purchases.

Suddenly you need to find a job, repay loans and make solid financial decisions. Fortunately, you don't need to be unprepared.\n\nTo keep your spending under control, start with a budget. If you have no idea how to create a budget, here's a look at how you may want to allocate your funds. Remember that these numbers are different for everyone, and you'll want to examine your own monthly spending to see what areas you should focus on.\n\n40% Housing and utilities\n15% Food\n10% Clothing and entertainment\n20% Debt payment and savings\n10% Transportation, including car loan\n5% Car insurance and personal expenses\n\nBeing financially responsible consists of more than simply organizing your spending habits. It means that you have a strong hold on your financial accounts. Here's what you need to know:\n\nMost people have three different financial accounts: Your checking account, savings account and credit cards.\n\nChecking Account\nOther employees will direct deposit your paycheck in this account. Your checking account is for your day-to-day expenses, like rent, groceries, and your student loans, etc.\n\nCredit Cards\nCredit cards are optional but they do help you build a good credit history. Credit cards can be used for emergencies, and some offer rewards or cash back that you can take advantage of.\n\nSavings Account\nA savings account is for longer term expenses. It also serves as a holding area until you decide to make a big purchase, or in an emergency fund.\n\nLong-Term Budget Goals\nAfter graduation, it's important to set long-term financial goals for yourself. How you handle money over the next few years is vital.\n\nFind a career path\nYou want more than a job that pays bills. By the time you are 30, you want to have a career.\n\nBuild an emergency fund\nBe prepared for the unexpected. Save money for at least 3 months' worth of expenses.\n\nPlan to repay your debt\nDebt doesn't just go away. Make a plan to repay loans and credit cards by the time you are 30.\n\nStart a retirement account\nAs graduates prepare to enter the workforce, finding a job in the right city is crucial. Here are the top 10 cities Kiplinger recommends for new grads.\n\nBest Cities for College Grads\nKey: Median income\nNat. average: $30,402\nMedian monthly rent\nNat. average: $817\nUnemployment rate\nNat. average: 9.2%\n\nSeattle, WA\n$33,372\n$942\n5.1%\n\nOmaha, NE\n$27,075\n$711\n5.1%\n\nNew York, N.Y.\n$34,029\n$1,072\n8.4%\n\nBoston, MA\n$36,174\n$1,112\n7.1%\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n$32,000\n$1,050\n8.5%\n\nColorado Springs, CO\n$26,977\n$802\n8.1%\n\nCharlotte, N.C.\n$33,396\n$774\n10.4%\n\nWashington, DC\n$40,962\n$1,226\n5.5%\n\nBaltimore, MD\n$32,994\n$972\n8.5%\n\nBest Tools for Personal Finance\nThere are many websites to help you track your spending and investments.

Our current growth patterns are highly inefficient and stand in the way of truly sustainable development. The way forward is inclusive green growth that is clean in its treatment of the environment, efficient in its use of natural resources, resilient, and meets the needs of all people.  \n\nWHY GREEN GROWTH?  \nFor the past 250 years, economic growth has come largely at the expense of the environment. The damage has reached a scale that threatens human welfare and prospects for future growth, and despite impressive gains in the last two decades, many basic needs remain unmet.  \nTwo decades of unprecedented growth have greatly improved welfare...  \nPOVERTY RATE  \n42%  \n25%  \n15%  \n1990 2005 2015  \n*Projected*  \n...but not without a significant toll on the environment.  \n3X  \nIncrease in water withdrawals in last 50 years, leading to water scarcity and ground water depletion.  \n13 MILLION  \nHectares of forest lost annually between 2000 and 2010, equivalent to the size of Nicaragua lost every year.  \n550 BILLION+  \nTons of CO2 emitted globally from 1990 to 2010.  \n85%  \nOcean fisheries categorized as fully exploited, over-exploited, or depleted.  \n$1 TRILLION  \nSpent annually to subsidize the over-exploitation of natural capital, including fossil fuels.  \nMeanwhile, massive basic needs remain unmet.  \nPeople without access to sanitation  \n2.6 BILLION  \nPeople without access to electricity  \n1.3 BILLION  \nPeople without safe, clean drinking water  \n900 MILLION  \n\nGREEN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES  \nAs countries continue to grow and urbanize, we must design energy, transportation, and agricultural systems that facilitate commerce while limiting environmental impacts. Today, 2.6 billion people live in cities. By 2030, there will be 4 billion. Sustainable energy is one opportunity for green growth. There are others.  \n1 DENSITY  \nUrban density enables more efficient land use, transportation, and services.  \n2 EFFICIENCY  \nEnergy-efficiency technologies can reduce energy consumption and costs.  \n3 TRANSPORT  \nGreen residents and businesses benefit from efficient transport systems.  \n4 OCEANS  \nBetter management could increase the wealth of global fisheries from $120 billion to $900 million.  \n5 INDUSTRY  \nEvery $1 invested in energy efficiency saves at least $2 in energy expenses.  \n6 LANDSCAPES  \nSound forest and watershed management boosts household incomes and, along with climate-smart agriculture, bolsters resilience to drought, landslides, and flooding.  \n\nMEASURING GREEN GROWTH  \nA country can increase its GDP by exploiting natural capital, but overuse of those resources will reduce the country's national wealth.

First reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, MERS is considered new.  \nMERS is caused by a coronavirus called \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\" or MERS-CoV. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that caused illness in humans and animals.  \nMERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that is transmitted from animals to humans. According to the analysis of different virus genomes, it is believed that it originated in bats and was transmitted to camels sometime in the distant past.  \nApproximately 36% of reported patients with MERS-CoV have died.  \n\nSYMPTOMS  \nSevere, acute respiratory illness  \nFever  \nCough  \nBreathing difficulties  \nGastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea  \n\nTRANSMISSION  \nNon-human to human transmission: The route of transmission from animals to humans is not fully understood, but camels are likely to be a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of infection in humans.  \nHuman-to-human transmission: The virus does not appear to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient.  \n\nVACCINE?  \nNo vaccine or specific treatment is currently available for MERS. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient\u2019s clinical condition.  \n\nCOUNTRIES WITH CONFIRMED CASES  \nFROM MARCH 2012 - PRESENT, AS OF JULY 6, 2015  \nUnited States of America  \nNetherlands  \nGermany  \nAustria  \nJordan  \nOman  \nGreece  \nAlgeria  \nTurkey  \nEgypt  \nKuwait  \nSaudi Arabia  \nIran  \nChina  \nRepublic of Korea  \nMalaysia  \nFrance  \nItaly  \nPhilippines  \nQatar  \nUnited Kingdom (UK)  \nTunisia  \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)  \n\nAS OF JULY 6, 2015  \n1,366 CONFIRMED CASES  \nR.I.P. 487 DEATHS  \n\nPRECAUTIONS AGAINST MERS  \nFrequently wash your hands with soap or hand rubs with alcohol.  \nAvoid contact with the sick or those infected with MERS-CoV.  \nIf you have respiratory illness, stay home and wear a surgical mask to protect your family.  \nPractice proper cough etiquette by covering your mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing. Use facial tissues and dispose in a waste basket.  \nAvoid contact with farm and domesticated animals, including camels.  \nIf you are a health worker, strictly follow infection control protocols in your work.  \nVisit your doctor, a hospital or health facility immediately if symptoms of MERS-CoV manifest, including persistent coughing.  \nGet regular exercise, eat a balanced diet, and get adequate sleep as all these will help strengthen the body\u2019s immunity.  \nMake sure meat, milk, and other animal products are safe for consumption. The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection.  \n\nAT RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE FROM MERS-CoV INFECTION:  \nOlder people  \nPeople with weakened immune systems  \nPeople with chronic diseases such as cancer, chronic lung disease, diabetes, and renal failure  \n\nSource: Department of Health and Department of Foreign Affairs, World Health Organization  \nText by Trisha Macas | Design by Analyn Perez  ", "44604.jpeg": "1908 Oskar Wetzell (Finland)  \nHe did not win medals but has the honor of being the first deaf person in the world to participate in the Olympics  \n1928 Carlo Orlandi (Italy)  \nAmsterdam 1928  \n1928 Donald Gollan (United Kingdom)  \n1952 Ignazio Fabra (Italy)  \nHelsinki 1952 Melbourne 1956  \n1960 Ildik\u00f3 \u00dajlaky-Rejt\u0151 (Hungary)  \nMontreal 1972 Munich 1972 Mexico 1968 Rome 1960 Tokyo 1964  \n1984 Jeffrey Float (USA)  \nLos Angeles 1984  \n2000 Terence Parkin (South Africa)  \nSydney 2000  \n2004 Tamika Catchings (USA)  \nAthens 2004 Beijing 2008 London 2012 Rio 2016  \n2016 David Smith (USA)  \nRio 2016  ", "44529.jpeg": "London 2012 will be the BIGGEST Paralympic Games ever\n\n150 countries (72% of the world) will be participating in 11 days of sport\n\nAugust / September\n\n4200 ATHLETES\n\n16% \n27% \n5%\n\nRome 1960 400 athletes\nAthens 2004 3960 athletes\nBeijing 2008 3931 athletes\n\nALL COMPETING TO WIN GOLD\n\nCombined Effort\n\nRome 1960 8 Sports\nAthens 2004 10 Sports\nBeijing 2008 20 Sports\nLondon 2012 20 Sports\n\nCOMBINED EFFORT\n\nTeam officials\nMedia officials\nAthletes\nTechnical officials\n\nTICKET SALES\n\nLondon 2012 2,500,000\nAthens 2004 850,000\nBeijing 2008 180,000\n\nSources: Oberigne 2012", "44734.jpeg": "2012 LONDON OLYMPICS CONSTRUCTION  \nBrought to you by SMARTBIDNET Construction Bid Software  \nOlympic Village  \n2.5 square kilometers  \nBuilding for 16,000 athletes and officials  \nFrom 54 Nations  \nCompeting in 147 Gold Medals Events  \n27 July 2012 -

Recruiters connect with this instantly, and only then will they give your skills and credentials the full weight they deserve.\n\nFACTORS THAT CREATE YOUR WINNING PROFILE PHOTO\nResearch says that different photos of the same person leave impressions as varied as those of entirely different people.\nEvery person has 43 distinct facial muscles.\nThere are 7 universal facial expressions: happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, contempt and disgust.\nWhen you begin to mix these facial expressions together, the human face can make more than 10,000 slightly different expressions.\nNow add matters of dress, grooming, light, camera angles, and camera distortion/editing to this complication of microexpressions, and you see how every photo tells a unique story.\n\nHOW TO GET A WINNING PROFILE PHOTO\nDON'T OBSTRUCT YOUR EYES\nLook 10% less likable. Eye obstruction via hair, glare, and shadow didn't make a difference in likability, but brought down perceived competency by 15% and influence by 8%.\nSMILE WITH TEETH\nIn regards to making someone like and trust you, smiling with teeth shows the riskier effect of smiling with your mouth closed!\nDRESS FORMALLY\nDoing so for the picture does wonders for getting you hired, as people perceive you to be 43% more competent and 58% more influential in your industry.\nHIRE A PRO\nHave the photo professionally taken.
