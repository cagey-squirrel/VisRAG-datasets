NIH has always believed that the persons most capable of evaluating a scientific field are scientists themselves -- on the NIH staff or elsewhere in the scientific community. They are best qualified to examine the efforts and objectives of their colleagues, to set priorities, and to assist in obtaining an appropriate balance within the health-related research effort. To investigate how NIH might avail itself of this expertise, Dr. Joseph C. Hwang, Chief of the Scientific Evaluation Section, Office for Research Analysis and Evaluation in the Division of Research Grants, suggested that the Division conduct a series of evaluation conferences. The proposal was endorsed by the then Associate Director for Research Analysis and Evaluation, Dr. Ashley T. Bever, and four conferences were held in the fall of 1968. The conference dealing with Nutrition and Developmental Biology forms the basis for this report.\n\nIt is hoped that this report and the others resulting from these conferences will suggest a possible format for future evaluation of scientific fields that will provide an improved rationale for allocation choices.", "snbx0223_p8.jpg": "ITC Limited REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013\n\nBINGO!\n\nAssociated with youth, fun and excitement, Bingo! offers multiple variants of Potato Chips and Finger snacks to fulfil the consumer\u2019s need for variety and novelty with innovative formats and \u2018irresistible combinations\u2019 in flavours.\n\nCANDYMAN | MINT-O\n\nCandyman and mint-o offer a mouth-watering range of confectionery products in a variety of flavours and formats which delight consumers across age groups.\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/snbx0223", "snbx0223_p14.jpg": "ITC Limited  \nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013  \n\nA slew of innovative products are already in the market and there is a continuous pipeline of such products that are being readied for launch.

Correlation of the two sets of results was excellent.

Such a correlation was indeed shown to exist. This provides us with a screening tool to investigate whether or not fillers will have unacceptably long drainage times.\n\nProject Tomorrow\n\nThe second trial run of the \"daubing dandy\" at the University of Maine took place last week. Attempts to use a more viscous cellulose slurry in order to obtain well-defined bands were not successful. The short distance between the \"daubing dandy\" and the couch roll did not allow for sufficient drainage, and the still wet web continually wound itself around the first press roll. When the cellulose level was cut in half, paper was made successfully. However, band definition was not sufficient. The last attempt utilized a 2% microcrystalline cellulose as the feedstock. Drainage time was adequate for this material, and a considerable amount of paper was run. Band spreading still occurred; however, the resulting paper was clearly branded. For the next trial a second shell will be made with 2 mm instead of 5 mm slits. This change will lead to less band spreading. Work will be carried out in the hand sheet lab in order to find a material which will increase slurry viscosity without increasing drainage time. Lastly, attempts will be made to increase the distance between the dandy and the couch roll in order to allow for longer drainage time.\n\nPM Web\n\nThe patent specification from James River describing their proprietary cellulose acetate web has been requested and will be sent.\n\nWe have located a Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, which has considerable experience in the acetylation of cellulose webs as well as cellulose pulps.

It was designed to our specifications to measure CO2 and CO in the 0-10% range.\n\nThe multigas calibration/zero-air system has been installed. The system design provides required levels of ozone, carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide to perform zero, span checks and multiport calibration of our current Thermo Environmental instruments.\n\nNew Expansion Processes - Stress relaxation and recovery tests were carried out with bright lamina to simulate expansion and collapse using the Dynastat instrument. The lamina were conditioned to 75% RH (16% OV) and then stretched by 50-100% using the \"zero span\" technique. The strain was then maintained constant and the time dependence of the stress was monitored. The stress relaxation rates were found to be very rapid with the stress falling to 33% of its initial value within one second. The relaxation rate did not appear to be a strong function of the initial strain.\n\nTower exit expanded tobacco was reordered to OV values ranging from 5 to 35%. Both the reordering rates and the final OV values varied during the process. The resulting SV values were found to decrease in an approximately sigmoidal fashion as the final OV increased. The steepest portion of the curve appears to be around 60% RH (11.5 to 12% OV). The results indicate the collapse is sensitive to both the reordering rate and the final OV value.\n\nFILTER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT:\n\nConcentric Filters - MEGA look-a-like test (concentric) and control (CA mono) models were made with MFUL filler.

The only comments from the panelists were that the control had slightly increased impact and was more peppery than the test.\n\nSamples of FTR-produced Mega cigarettes with CA mono and the current concentric filter have been received. The cigarettes are currently being analytically tested.\n\nWeb Filter Development - Sample webs were produced at the University of Maine using 75% 1/8\" cut CA staple and 25% softwood fiber. Various refining levels were evaluated and CMC and PVA binders were used to improve elongation.

Formation during curing occurs through nitrosation. Occurrence in smoke results from pyrosynthesis or by direct transfer from tobacco. NNK is found in both mainstream smoke and in sidestream smoke. NNK is carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Hoffman et al. 1981, (Reference 1) states NNK is a strong carcinogen which induces lung adenomas in mice, carcinomas in the nasal cavity, liver and lung of rats, tracheal tumors and carcinomas of the nasal cavity and lung of hamsters. Hoffman et al. 1986, (Reference 2) depict NNK as one of the most powerful carcinogens in tobacco smoke. They say NNK induces benign and malignant tumors in laboratory animals in both the upper respiratory tract and in the lung. According to Hoffman et al. 1985, (Reference 3) 1 mg of NNK will induce lung tumors in hamsters.  \n\nBurley tobacco contains higher levels of NNK and other tobacco-specific nitrosamines than do other types of tobacco. Air-curing under hot, humid conditions increases the amounts found (Reference 4). Andersen et al. 1985, (Reference 5) measured levels of NNK. They used Ky 14 burley grown under different shade conditions and air-cured. They also used air-cured and homogenized-leaf-cured burley tobaccos from conventionally grown tobaccos with different alkaloid genotypes. They found NNK contents ranged from 0.2 \u00b5g/g - 0.5 \u00b5g/g in air-cured Ky 14 tobacco from leaves grown under 0 - 65% shade (100, 65, 35% of natural light). The highest NNK concentrations were from 45% shade-grown lamina from the lower leaf positions on stalks according to this study. Andersen et al concluded that NNK contents increased in lamina from successively lower leaf positions of non-shade-grown and 45% shade-grown plants. They believe this is due to the leaves of the lower stalk positions being more mature than the leaves from the upper stalk positions. Andersen et al concluded that levels of NNK increased during each stage of homogenized-leaf-curing in the tested tobacco genotypes. Their study indicated that NNK accumulated to a larger extent than NNN in the homogenized-leaf-cured high-alkaloid burley tobacco. NNK was significantly lower in the low-alkaloid line than in the high-alkaloid line for both the air-cured and the homogenized-leaf-cured tobaccos at each period of measurement throughout storage according to this study. MacKown et al. 1984, (Reference 6) postulate that fertilization with nitrogen plays a role in the amounts of tobaccospecific nitrosamines found in tobacco. Burley tobacco generally receives more nitrogen fertilizer than does flue-cured tobacco. NNK levels were measured in several burley genotypes in 1981 when there was no nitrogen fertilization. The levels ranged from 0.05 - 0.23 ppm. In 1982, with nitrogen fertilizer applied, the levels ranged from 0.08 - 0.71 ppm.

A managed care elasticity study completed in 2000, looking at Prempro pricing, indicated that the list price could be increased to $29.00 for a month supply without raising strong resistance from managed care. The direct price for a month supply as of March 2001 is $24.97 and $22.80 for Prempro and Premphase respectively.\n\nAverage Selling Price: The weighted ASP is listed below.

Inexpensive drugs such as Premarin appear on most formularies, approximately 99% with Prempro on approximately 96% of all formularies across the United States. Prescription drugs, such as raloxifene and some transdermal products, are less likely to be reimbursed. As a consequence, the bottom line for third-party payors, physicians, and patients themselves, will always factor into prescribing and consumption patterns in the ERT/HRT market. Pricing of new drugs must therefore remain competitive in each of the major markets if newer agents are to gain patient and clinician acceptance.\n\nManaged care organizations have made strong inroads in serving both the Medicare and non-Medicare populations in the United States. Managed care is a mixed blessing with regard to the future of ERT/HRT in the United States. In the short term, cost constraints may initially depress the market prospects of higher-cost products. In the long run, however, the trend toward preventive strategies and the expected positive results of major trials (e.g. WHI, WISDOM, and RUTH) could pay off for therapies that offer a proven preventive benefit as well as symptom relief.\n\n6.

Agarbhatti Value Chain The linkage of ITC's Women's Empowerment Programme to ITC's Agarbhatti Business with the brand Mangaldeep is yet another unique example of livelihood creation through competitive value chains. Rural women have been trained to roll agarbhattis which are sourced by the Company's Agarbhatti Business, thereby empowering women with a stable source of income. Through ITC's Women's Empowerment Programme, nearly 40,000 women today have been gainfully employed either through micro-enterprises or assisted with loans to pursue income generating activities.

Project BOLD: An RTD study to evaluate the MUL blend with 50% expanded at RTD levels of approximately 75, 100 and 130 mm was completed. Results indicate a subjective preference for the low RTD models (90 and 100 mm).\n\nAMBROSIA: Monadic Menthol POL-0637 cigarettes (1% CR-2898 by weight on cigarette wrapper) have been made and shipment is scheduled for the week of May 28. Models have been made utilizing filler oversprayed with CR-2898 and Aromatek 150 separately for subjective comparison vs. models with wrapper and adhesive applications. Evaluations are in progress. Cigarette wrapper coated with CR-2911 (t-BOC-protected CR-2898) was compared to CR-2898 on finished cigarettes both subjectively and analytically. Evaluations indicate the CR-2911 was subjectively comparable to CR-2898. National Starch is attempting to assess the adhesive incorporating Aromatek-150 with regard to quality issues. Additionally, they will attempt to formulate adhesives which contain CR vanillin release compounds (CR-2905 & 2910).\n\nPROJECT GRAIN: Cambridge cigarettes made from filler sprayed in the Semiworks showed comparable anethole and vanillin levels for control versus test aftercuts (sonolated and nonsonolated) with 30% reduction in alcohol. Since the production filler control showed a higher than target anethole level, only the Semiworks Cambridge control is being compared to the test cigarettes. Initial panel screening by Flavor Development showed no obvious differences between the control and sonolated test, but differences were found between the control and nonsonolated test aftercut cigarettes. Further tests are in progress.\n\nPROJECT TARGET (BUCKS): Subjective evaluations of previously made Bucks prototypes with current, two modified and no aftercut are continuing. Additional flavor work aimed at reducing the rod aroma and increasing the Camel-like character is in progress. Two cases each of Bucks Full Flavor and Lights have been received and submitted for SOLVIC spotting determinations. Results were 0.5 spots per 2,000 cigarettes for the Full Flavor and 1.5 spots per 2,000 for the Lights products.", "trgj0223_p91.jpg": "Jalaram Engineering Company  \nJagan Engineering Company  \nKala Asayer & Components  \nKanal Plastics  \nKrishna Offset  \nMutual Spring Steel Mfg.

The thinness of the product and the attractive packaging suggested that this was a cigarette for the female who wanted to look \"dressed up\" when out on the town or at a social event.\n\nAfter Trial-Likes and Dislikes\n\nThe primary like of VSSS was the attractive packaging. Only a couple of smokers said they liked VSSS for the low smoke. Overall, there were not that many dislikes concerning the product. The dislikes which were most frequently mentioned were intensity, thinness, and hard draw. As with any new cigarette, comments are expected concerning intensity--if for no other reason than it is not the consumer's regular brand. Those who perceived that VSSS self-extinguish in the ashtray said that this was more of an annoyance than a problem. Some felt that they were not getting their money's worth because the cigarette was thin. Of those who noticed that the ash stayed on longer, half liked and half disliked this aspect. During the discussion on likes and dislikes only twenty percent gave unsolicited comments on the topic of low smoke.\n\nSuggestions for Improvements\n\nThe number one suggestion for improvement was to make a low smoke product that was full circumference 100 (25 mm) or at least the circumference of a regular Virginia Slims (23mm). The second suggestion was to reduce and/or increase strength.\n\nLow Visible Smoke\n\nWhen asked if it was important to have the option of low smoke, over a half replied yes. One third did not think this benefit was important. The remaining smokers had never thought about the concept of low smoke cigarettes. Quite a few who spoke favorably about low smoke also were thinking in terms of an odorless product. In other words, they perceived that low smoke and odorless, or at least a lighter odor, went hand in hand. These smokers felt that low smoke would be less annoying to the nonsmoker as well as smokers (e.g., to the VSSS smoker lingering odors). When these smokers were smoking VSSS, neither smokers nor nonsmokers made.", "xqvw0217_p1.jpg": "PROGRESS REPORT 12  \nOctober 22, 2002  \n\nPROJECT CLASSIFICATION TARGET SUBMISSION DATE/JOURNAL STATUS / ACTION  \n\nPaper PS(3)  \nMetabolic and Hemostatic profile of postmenopausal women receiving a combined sequential regimen of either 1 mg estradiol and trimegestone or estradiol and norethisterone over a 1-year period  \nHemostasis/metabolic impact  \nApril 2003  \nFirst draft submitted for initial review April 19  \nComments received from Gary May 13  \nRevised draft to be submitted December 9  \nComments expected January 13  \nFinal paper to be submitted for review February 10  \nSign-off expected March 24  \n\nPAPERS FOR WMC SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS  \n\nPaper WMC(1)  \nThe preclinical biology of trimegestone: a new potent and selective progestin  \nPreclinical  \nDecember, 2002  \nFirst draft submitted for initial review July 29  \nClimacteric Suppl.  \n\nR.

But despite these familiar names, soft drinks actually contribute very little \"soda\"\u2014or sodium\u2014to the average diet. In fact, the majority of the soft drink products of Coca-Cola USA have less than 35 milligrams of sodium per serving\u2014allowing them to be classified by the Food and Drug Administration as \"very low sodium\" foods.\n\nThe sodium present in soft drinks comes from small amounts of sodium in the ingredients and from the local water used to make the beverage.\n\nAlthough potassium compounds are often used as substitutes, four basic sodium compounds may be used in preparing soft drink syrups. These include sodium benzoate, a food preservative; sodium chloride, or salt, for flavoring; sodium citrate, an acidity buffer; and the sweetener sodium saccharin. Each plays an important role in creating the flavor profile for the soft drinks in which it is used. The syrup is then combined with carbonated water to create the final soft drink product.\n\nThe amount of sodium contributed by the local water supply where the finished beverages are produced can vary seasonally and by locale. According to a 1975 survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, sodium content in U.S. fresh water ranges from traces to 402 milligrams per liter (0-71 milligrams per six-fluid ounces). But a 1982 survey of soft drink bottling plant water found that most local water supplies contain less than four milligrams of sodium per six-fluid ounces.\n\nThe amount of sodium in Coca-Cola USA soft drinks is negligible when compared to many other sources of sodium in the diet. For example, a six-fluid ounce serving of tomato juice processed with added salt has 660 milligrams of sodium, while the same size serving of diet Coke has 35 milligrams or less.\n\nMany people confuse sodium with common table salt. The two are not the same. Sodium is an element, the sixth most common on earth; table salt\u2014or sodium chloride\u2014is one of its compounds. Table salt contains 40 percent sodium and is one of many sodium sources in the diet.\n\nSodium, in the form of salt and other sodium compounds, is added during the chemical processing of food for safety, quality and taste enhancement. The rest is provided by salt added in cooking or at the table, and from sodium occurring naturally in foods and water.\n\nSodium is an essential nutrient in human physiology. In humans, sodium helps regulate water in the body by controlling the transfer of water and other nutrients across cell membranes. It also helps maintain blood pressure and volume, transmit nerve impulses and support the activity of certain enzyme systems.\n\nBecause of its ubiquitous nature, it can be found everywhere in the food supply. This is because the plants and animals that make up our food supply also use sodium for their life process.\n\nAlthough sodium is essential to life, medical experts suspect that, in addition to genetic sus-", "rgcw0217_p1.jpg": "Mission Statement of this Program: To promote the understanding of efficient and scientifically rigorous publication planning processes as a core component of the clinical development and commercialization processes within biopharmaceuticals.\n\nDear Colleague: Publication Planning is the process of creating timely and targeted disseminations of new scientific and clinical data throughout the life cycle of a product. In past years, the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology industries have paid minimal attention to this essential process and this can no longer be the case. The lengthy clinical development and regulatory review cycles increase the urgency to maximize a brand's contribution at launch. Therefore, a well-conceived and executed publication plan must be in place from early in a product's development and maintained throughout its lifecycle. The drive to maximize efficiencies and minimize waste affects all involved in the process, including the Industry, Academia and service providers. For a manufacturer, having research published in a highly-regarded peer-review medical journal or presented at a leading conference is desirable. It demonstrates to the audience the validity of the data presented in these selective vehicles and adds credibility to its subsequent use in educational or promotional initiatives. Ultimately this stream of credible publications and presentations helps to create awareness of the emerging clinical profile of a product, and to establish its place in practice. Therefore, a strong publications strategy becomes an excellent platform to jump-start a strong marketing plan, which can be translated into both educational and promotional activities. The key is to know where to begin and how to calculate the most beneficial publications program for your product to ensure optimal exposure.\n\nPharmaceutical Education Associates is proud to present Publication Planning 2003: Utilizing Scientifically Accurate, Commercially Relevant Strategies for Optimal Drug Acceptance and Exposure, the only conference of its kind.

However, a recent report from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative has resulted in confusion among health care providers and patients about the balance of risks and benefits associated with the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT). Now, more than ever, physicians and other health care professionals need appropriate information on the benefits and risks of the PREMARIN Family of Products to ensure that the standard of care for postmenopausal health is adequately promoted and that patients receive accurate information and individualized counseling about their personal risk-benefit profile.\n\nIn July 1997, DesignWrite initiated a comprehensive, peer-reviewed publication program in support of the PREMARIN Family of Products. The specific objectives of this program were: 1) to increase physician awareness of the multitude of benefits that HT provides for postmenopausal women; 2) to diminish the negative perceptions associated with estrogens; and 3) to blunt the competitive threat of new products introduced as alternatives to postmenopausal HT.\n\nThe success of this initial endeavor has led to the development and implementation of a number of programs, including:\n\n- Over 40 peer-reviewed publications\n- More than 40 scientific abstracts and posters at national meetings\n- Council on Hormone Education\n- Sales training backgrounds and journal article responses\n- Advisory boards/expert forums (with executive summaries) on selective estrogen-receptor modulators, lower-dose postmenopausal HT, acute cognitive symptoms, breast health, and sexuality\n- Journal supplements\n- Internal white papers\n- Pharmaceutical compendia surveillance program\n- Publications management program\n- Editorial assistance for key advocates\n- Women\u2019s HOPE Study clinical trial publications and associated slide kits\n- Branded slide kit for the Visiting Speakers Bureau\n- Progestins slide kit disseminated by Global Medical Affairs\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/fyww0217\n\nDWRITE 066196", "npvw0217_p5.jpg": "Subjects Signed Consent (signed consent form) N=103  \nSubjects Enrolled N=100  \nProtocol violation N=3 (Table 1)  \nSubject with baseline angiogram N=81  \nIVUS N=63  \nSubjects refused to continue in study N=19 (Table 2)  \nNo IVUS N=18  \nAll SVG occluded or diseased  ", "kmwn0226_p17.jpg": "It is important to understand that all Pinnacle system instrumentation is marked with true dimensions.

Stanford and Harvard Universities led the list of schools in the number applying, and five participants were selected from each of these schools. Three were selected from the University of California, and four schools had two students each. Fifteen schools were represented by one student each.\n\nThe training period extended from July 1 through September 1, 1959, with a limited extension for a small group of students. The program included a two-day introductory orientation of the student to the Department and to public health problems of the State; two plenary group teaching sessions of eight hours each at three-week intervals; the assignment of each student to a specifically planned project with a designated individual responsible as a preceptor; the assignment of selected reading; visits to local health departments; the preparation of a final report by each student of two parts\u2014the first, a subjective essay on the summer's experience and the second, a scientific report of the project on which he worked; and a written appraisal of the program by a questionnaire. In the assigned projects an effort was made to give the students experience in the delineation of a problem; the definition of objectives for a study; the preparation of a protocol or experimental design; the conduct of a specific study; the evaluation of results; and the presentation of a summary report subject to the criticism of his peers.\n\nIn evaluating the summer's experience, thirty-three of the thirty-six students rated the overall experience as \"very satisfactory\", three as \"satisfactory\", and no one reported the experience as \"unsatisfactory\". Thirty felt that they had made a contribution to the Department's work, and twenty-nine of the thirty-six expressed an interest in returning for another summer, if circumstances would permit. Twenty-three of the thirty-six students indicated they would be interested in participating in a similar program in the health department of their own state next year if such funding were available. Twenty of students indicated that they would recommend the program without reservation to fellow students, and most of those indicating reservations remarked on the predominantly epidemiologic nature of the activities in contrast to clinical or laboratory experiences.\n\nThe Departmental staff evaluating the program were generally more critical than the students, but supervisors of more than thirty of the thirty-six students indicated that they would be willing to participate in a similar program in future years. Most of the staff who expressed some reservation about the program were not satisfied with the background or preparation of a particular student for the project to which he was assigned. The staff generally concurred with the favorable student opinion of what was learned and felt that, in addition, almost all students contributed in some measure to the Department's work.\n\nThe 1959 summer training program was described in a paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine in October 1959.

However, Coca-Cola does not contain saccharin, and readers should be informed of this error.\n\nSecond, discussions of the safety of saccharin and acesulfame potassium present a selective and biased review of the data raising unsubstantiated fears among consumers. According to the National Cancer Institute, \u201cThere is no evidence that the regulated artificial sweeteners on the market in the United States are related to cancer risk in humans.\u201d The U.S. National Toxicology Program has removed saccharin from the list of established human carcinogens. And the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer confirmed that the evidence is inadequate to link saccharin with human cancer. More than 90 countries approve the use of saccharin.\n\nRegarding acesulfame potassium, about 90 scientific studies, versus three mentioned in the story, have thoroughly established the safety of acesulfame potassium. These studies are the basis for a number of government authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Commission of the European Communities, to conclude that acesulfame potassium is safe. The American Dietetic Association has also affirmed the safety of acesulfame potassium, even during pregnancy.\n\nMany individuals count on CSPI for nutrition and health advice. But when the scientific data and consensus of experts overwhelmingly differ from that reported in the Healthletter, readers are misinformed.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBarbara L.

The objectives stated above will be continued as well, and the following new messages will be incorporated.\n\nKey Issues/Message Strategies\n\nEmerging Benefits of HRT\n\nDocument the serious health consequences of estrogen loss with menopause and the potential benefits of HRT on the following conditions that were not highlighted in the previous plan:\n\n\u2022 Colorectal Cancer \u2014 review the literature that supports the beneficial effect of HRT on the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\n\n\u2022 Antioxidant Effects \u2014 review the literature for discussions of the potential antioxidant benefits of estrogens or HRT on cardiovascular disease, immune function, and other age-related conditions.\n\nBeneficial Effects of Low-Dose Estrogens and their Use in Postmenopausal Patients\n\nThe papers will review the literature that supports the beneficial effects of low-dose estrogens on all the physiological systems that might be affected by the decline in ovarian production of estrogens. Potential strategies for the use of low-dose estrogens will be promoted.\n\nBeneficial Effects of HRT for Healthy Aging and Enhanced Vitality\n\nThe papers will include messages regarding the importance of quality of life issues that are the trademark of HRT use.

In addition, they could address trends in treatment and topical issues in patient management.\n\nJournal Supplements\n\nSelected data derived from individual studies could be published together as supplements to target journals within a particular therapeutic specialty. Should the client wish to pursue this publication option, the following guidelines are applicable. A turnaround time of six months is generally adhered to for producing the supplement. This includes all editorial components, including interactions with invited authors, and the target journal. Timing of the publication is ultimately predicated by the individual journal's supplement schedule.

Note that thrombin was ineffective in activating TGase. Further evidence for a nonmitogenic role for trypsin activation is that high TGase activity appears to be contrary to the proliferative state in this system (FIGURE 2 & TABLE I). Rather, the activation seemed to be related to some other consequence of trypsin administration.\n\nTRANSGlutaminase AND FIBRONECTIN\n\nThe rapidity with which trypsin activated TGase suggested that hydrolytic cleavage of a cell surface component might be involved, with cleavage of this component apparently leading to solubilization of TGase activity. Similarly, the differential effects of trypsin and pronase as compared to that of thrombin on activating TGase parallels their action in cleaving a cell surface glycoprotein found in several fibroblast cells. This glycoprotein has received many names, including\n\nTABLE 3 TRANSGlutaminase ACTIVITY AFTER MITOGEN TREATMENT\n\nTreatment* Concentration Treated Activity Untreated Activity\n\nMedium change\u2020 CaCl2 1.8-5 mM 0.9, 0.9 Trypsin\u2021 5 \u00b5g/ml 2.7 \u00b1 0.3 (5) Pronase\u00a7 5 \u00b5g/ml 1.7, 1.8 Thrombin\u0192 5 \u00b5g/ml 1.1, 1.3\n\n*Cultures were washed (except those that received the medium change) and incubated with the appropriate reagent in Earle's solution for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C prior to assay. \n\u2020Modified McCoy's medium 5a (2) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Reheis Chemical Corporation). \n\u2021Worthington Biochemical Corporation. \n\u00a7Calbiochem. \n\u0192Parke-Davis, topical.\n\nfibronectin, which will be used in this discussion. Most of these surface proteins are thought to be the same protein and cross-react immunologically with the serum protein, cold-insoluble globulin. These proteins are apparently transformation sensitive, since they are lost from the cell surface after transformation. Trypsin and pronase catalyze removal of fibronectin from fibroblasts, whereas thrombin fails to do so under similar conditions. To determine whether a relationship between TGase and fibronectin exists, a comparative study was undertaken.\n\nInitially, surface fibronectin in WI-38 cells was labeled by the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination procedure with 125I. Addition of trypsin to these labeled cells resulted in an enzyme-dependent loss of 60-75% of the radioactive label within 30 min. While the 125I studies provided circumstantial evidence of fibronectin involvement, we desired to confirm these findings by another method.\n\nWI-38 and WI-38 VA13A cells demonstrated a differential in fluorescence when stained by indirect immunofluorescence with goat antifibronectin antiserum.

Process water can be readily cleaned and discharged.\n\nDemonstration plant\n\nThe SCGP-1 demonstration plant in Houston will confirm equipment life and the scale-up information necessary for commercial design. Environmental design data for potential commercial feedstocks will also be acquired. SCGP-1 includes equipment for different feedstocks process optimisations. These will increase steam factor and system reliability, and reduce capital and operating costs. A final objective for SCGP-1 is to move toward commercialisation of the process, in part by developing an experienced operating team with extensive operating knowledge, which will be transferable to the first commercial plant.\n\nAt approximately one-fifth the anticipated initial commercial module size, SCGP-1 is the most efficient route to commercialisation of the process. It is much less costly to construct and operate than a full-scale unit and provides the opportunity to test process optimisations more readily. The maximum scale-up factor of five for any given piece of equipment is well within Shell capabilities; the lower limit on size was actually set by a requirement to demonstrate equipment and configurations that would be employed commercially. Many of the components will require little or no scaling.\n\nThe unit will include coal receiving and preparation facilities, a high-temperature gasifier, and a gas clean-up system. The gasifier will be water treating to provide both medium-BTU gas for power generation and high-value steam for process heat and a scheduled start-up in the first half of 1987.\n\nSCGP-1 is designed to easily feed from lignites to bituminous coals. In particular, different feedstocks, such as petroleum coke, could also be gasified. Feeds will normally be received by train or truck (as-received Illinois high sulfur coal) to 400 t/d (as-received lignite). The unit is capable of handling feedstocks with up to 35% moisture, 30% ash and 4% sulphur at design gas production rates. Treated product gas will contain approximately 99% hydrogen and carbon monoxide (nitrogen-free basis), less than 160 ppm sulphur compounds, and other minor trace components. Actual nitrogen content in the product gas will depend on whether nitrogen or another gas such as recycled product gas or carbon monoxide is used as coal feed transport gas. The Shell Deer Park Manufacturing Complex was chosen as the SCGP-1 location primarily because it can make use of the product gas. Also, some of the utility requirements can be met by existing facilities.\n\nOxygen and nitrogen will be used for road and ship loading and other applications, while acid gas will be sent to the Deer Park Complex sulphur plant. Stripped effluent and storm water will be sent to the Complex effluent treating system.\n\nSlip stream\n\nThe SCGP-1 acid gas removal system is designed to meet very strict environmental regulations. A treating slip stream will be installed and operated as part of the overall premise. Effluent water slip stream units will also be included. Pouredly designed slip stream units operating on SCGP-1 product streams are cost-effective methods of testing options and can provide the necessary data for design commercial plants with varying environmental constraints and product uses.\n\nParticipants\n\nCombustion Engineering's subsidiary Lummus Crest and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) are jointly participating with Shell Chemical in designing, constructing and operating SCGP-1. Lummus Crest will provide engineering design and procurement services. EPRI will provide an electric utility industry perspective. Shell International Petroleum, Shell International Research, Deutsche Shell, Shell Oil and Shell Development provided the process design, construction and engineering design information, and will operate and manage the unit and experimental programme.", "hhwh0078_p0.jpg": "SUPPORT SERVICES % Ord.

Usage of low-alkaloid burley tobaccos are recommended by their study to reduce exposure to NNK. Hoffmann et al, (Reference 1) measured levels of NNK which ranged from 0.13 - 35 ppm in tobacco products. Andersen et al, (Reference 5), conclude usage of low-alkaloid burley tobaccos and control of the postharvest processes can lower levels of NNK in tobacco products. NNK is suspected to be a causative factor in oral cancers among smokeless tobacco users. Hecht et al, 1988, (Reference 7) measured levels of NNK for smokeless tobacco products as well as cigarette smoke. The amounts of NNK in smokeless tobacco ranged from 0.03 - 14 ppm. Hoffmann et al (Reference 1) measured levels of NNK in smokeless tobacco products which ranged from 0.59 - 4.65 ppm. Chamberlain et al, 1988, (Reference 8) measured levels of NNK between 0.3 - 7.37 ppm in smokeless tobacco products. Exposure of humans to NNK and other nitrosamines is higher with smokeless tobacco products than from cigar or cigarette smoke (Reference 9). Levels of NNK in the saliva of snuff-dipping women ranged from 2.1 - 201 ng/g according to Hoffmann et al (Reference 1). Hecht et al (Reference 7) cite work done by Winn et al in 1981, (Reference 10), showing oral cancer rates among snuff-dipping white non-smoking women to be 4.2 and among chronic users the risk increased 50-fold for cancers of the gum and buccal mucosa. Another study done by Winn et al, 1984, (Reference 11) indicates a diet high in fruits and vegetables protects against the formation of oral cancers among snuff dippers and cigarette smokers. The largest nonoccupational exposure to preformed nitrosamines is derived from tobacco products and tobacco smoke (Reference 9). It has been estimated that US residents receive the highest degree of exposure to nitrosamines from cigarette smoking (Reference 2). NNK is one of the most powerful carcinogens in cigarette smoke according to Hoffmann et al (Reference 2). As previously discussed, NNK causes tumors and carcinomas in laboratory animals. Hoffmann et al, 1980 (Reference 12) measured levels of NNK in mainstream smoke which ranged from 0.11 - 4.2\u03bcg/cigarette in selected cigarettes and cigars. Hecht et al (Reference 7) cites levels of NNK in mainstream smoke to range from 0.017 - 0.43\u03bcg/cigarette. Hoffmann et al (Reference 3) states there is between 80 - 770 ng/cigarette of NNK in mainstream smoke from nonfiltered cigarettes. They give a range of 30 - 150 ng/cigarette of NNK in mainstream smoke of filtered cigarettes. For cigars, they give a range of 1,900 - 4,200 ng/cigar of NNK. They also state that a cigarette smoker inhales about 0.07\u03bcmol of NNK/kg per year on the average. Work by Adams et al, 1983, (Reference 12) indicate that 26 - 37% of NNK found in mainstream smoke transfers directly from the tobacco. Their work also states that 63 - 74% of the NNK found in mainstream smoke forms by pyrolysis during smoking. Fischer et al, 1990, (Reference 13) conducted a study on German nonfiltered cigarettes. They list values of NNK to range from 186 - 432 ng/cigarette. They indicate that the amount of NNK in the mainstream smoke depends on the nitrate level of the tobacco. The tobacco type, the filter type, and the butt length are factors which can influence the amounts of NNK found in mainstream smoke. Fischer et al (Reference 13) believe that pyro synthesis of NNK during smoking is unlikely for tobaccos with lower nitrate levels. They indicate NNK formation during smoking is possible for dark tobaccos or tobaccos with high nitrate levels. The results", "jmlh0227_p7.jpg": "Table 3.

My acquaintanceship with Dr. Matovinovic dates from about 1949 or 1950 when, as a consultant for the World Health Organization on nutrition in Yugoslavia, I had the opportunity of meeting this remarkable, highly able young physician-scientist. During the post-World War II period Josip Matovinovic became the leading scientist in Yugoslavia concerned with endemic goiter and iodine deficiency. He provided the leadership and developed the expertise not only in the field of medicine but in the technology of iodization to establish the national program of iodization of salt in that country. This program has profoundly reduced the enormous problem of goiter and cretinism that existed before its initiation.\n\nThroughout the period of the 1950's onward, I have subsequently been associated with Josip Matovinovic in activities to which he has given, again, remarkable leadership with the World Health Organization in their program of control of endemic goiter.

The \"multiple sweetener\" concept allows for flexibility in providing the best-tasting products for consumers by making available as many sweeteners as possible. As research and development on new sweeteners continue, this flexibility will broaden the entire low-calorie market.\n\nOther Considerations  \nFoods containing sugar (and certain other ingredients) are sometimes criticized for providing \"empty calories\"\u2014because they supply energy with only small amounts of other nutrients. While this may be true, it is the total dietary intake\u2014the kind and amount of foods eaten\u2014that determines whether a diet is healthful. Of course, one type of food cannot supply all the nutrients needed for good health. Only a varied diet will supply the appropriate combination of essential nutrients.\n\nSweeteners which add calories to food provide us with energy and contribute to the enjoyment of meals and snacks. Scientific research shows that these sweeteners can contribute to a healthy diet\u2014as long as they are eaten sensibly and in moderation.\n\nAlthough low-calorie sweeteners contribute little or no energy, saccharin and aspartame are important for many Americans. By providing an alternative to sugar-containing foods and beverages, these low-calorie sweeteners add to our enjoyment and choice of diet foods.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company markets a variety of both sugar-sweetened and low-calorie soft drinks, enabling consumers to select refreshment tailored to their individual tastes and needs.\n\nFor more technical information on sweeteners or other ingredient-related questions, please write or call:  \nConsumer Information Center  \nCoca-Cola USA  \nP.O.

Our cells are asking for needed proteins.  \n4) Milk is the most nourishing fluid available, rich in protein, vitamins and minerals.  \n\nJ. Carbohydrates and Fat  \n1. They are needed for energy.  \n2. They are fuels; the body burns them to produce heat and to provide energy for work and play.  \n3. Any amounts of carbohydrate and fat consumed beyond what is needed for energy are turned into fat and contribute to overweight.  \n\nK. Carbohydrates = Sugars and Starches  \n1. Sugar  \na. Sugar is pure carbohydrate = no fat, no vitamins, no minerals, no protein.  \nb. Types of sugar  \n1) Sucrose = table sugar; provides food energy but nothing else.  \n2) Glucose = blood sugar; manufactured by the body from its daily intake of food, mainly from proteins, also from carbohydrates.  \n3) Fructose = fruit and honey sugar; fruit = fructose plus valuable nutrients.  \n4) Lactose = milk sugar.  \nc. Sugar is useful as a quick fuel for your muscles; one of the sugars that is a source of energy = glucose = found in fruit juices.  \nd. Why should we limit the amount of sugar we eat?  \n1) We should have some sugar rich food each day, but should not eat too much of these foods, because we need to save.  \n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/mfcl0227", "nrcj0037_p6.jpg": "Appendix I - Results of Method Development Project Survey\n\nPROJECT CUSTOMER PRIORITY DURATION MONTHS DATE NEEDED BUSINESS NEED\nDevelop Better Cut Width Measurement Method KRK 4.0 6 DEC 93 GPC Cost Reduction\nMACON QA Flavor/Concentrate Methods KRK 6.0 4 MAR94 Project T/C Prod.

It is a simple nutritive sweetener, chemically identical to the sweetener found commonly in fruits and honey.  \n\n2. What is the Difference Between Fructose Sweetener and Ordinary Sugar?  \nOrdinary white refined sugar, or sucrose, is a complex sweetener derived primarily from cane and sugar beets. It breaks down into equal parts of two simple sugars, fructose and dextrose. The sweetener Shasta is now using in its line of soft drinks, High Fructose Corn Sweetener 55, breaks down into 55 per cent fructose, 42 per cent dextrose and three per cent non-sweetening compounds. Because it contains a higher percentage of fructose, fructose corn sweetener is sweeter than ordinary sugar.  \n\n3. Aren't Fructose Sweetener and Corn Syrup the Same Thing?  \nNo. Corn syrup is a heavy syrup with a low dextrose content. High Fructose Corn Sweetener is a brand new form of superior sweetener that is lighter, sweeter and much better tasting.  \n\n4. Isn't Fructose a Relatively New Form of Sweetener?  \nFructose Sweetener 55 has become commercially available only in the past few years. However, in that time it has become an increasingly popular sweetener for processed foods such as baked goods, jams, salad dressings and the like. It is being used by such companies as Sara Lee, Del Monte and Smuckers, in a variety of their products.  \n\n5. Isn't Fructose a Low-Calorie Sweetener?  \nBecause fructose sweetener is sweeter than sucrose, Shasta can use less of it to obtain the desired level of sweetness. However, it is not a low-calorie form of sweetener, like saccharin. Because we are now using less sweetener in our regular line of soft drinks, their calorie content has been reduced some ten per cent, compared to the old formulation.  \n\n6. Why Did Shasta Switch to Fructose?  \nThree reasons; better taste; growing consumer concern over sugar; and economic benefits for Shasta, our customers and the country.  \nBecause fructose sweetener is a chemically simpler sweetener, it enhances the taste of our products, rather than masking them as ordinary sugar often does. In extensive consumer taste tests, Shasta Cola was judged to have a lighter, less sugary and less syrupy taste when compared to Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.  \nConsumers are growing increasingly concerned about their intake of ordinary sugar. Current sugar consumption averages nearly 95 pounds per person and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has called for a 45 per cent per person reduction in the refined sugar intake. Fructose sweetener provided Shasta the opportunity to offer those consumers an alternative to soft drinks sweetened with ordinary refined sugar. An alternative offering fewer carbohydrates and calories, and better taste.  \nFor more information on this growing concern over the consumption of ordinary refined sugar, see the following books:  \nSugar Blues, by William Dufty;  \nDiet Away Your Stress, Tension and Anxiety;  \nThe Fructose Diet Book, by J. Daniel Palm, Ph.D.  \nDr. Cooper's Fabulous Fructose Diet, by J.T. Cooper, M.D.;  \nSweet and Dangerous, by John Yudkin, M.D.  \nA final reason for our conversion involved economics. Because fructose sweeteners costs less than ordinary sugar, Shasta can continue to offer its great tasting soft drinks at prices lower than other national brands. In addition, fructose is available at stable prices and in dependable quantities unlike refined sugar from foreign sources. Also, the development of the domestic sweetener industry contributes to the economic well-being of the United States through the development of jobs and favorable contributions to the U.S. balance of trade.  \n\n7. Will Shasta be using Fructose in Its Diet Products?  \nBecause fructose is not a non-calorie sweetener, Shasta will continue to use saccharin for sweetening of its diet products. However, we are in the process of reformulating our diet line. News on that reformulation will be forthcoming this fall. It will still be a low calorie or non-calorie line.  \n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/ykpj0226", "fydc0228_p9.jpg": "Points of interest about Evansville\n\n1.

Since data from NHANES is largely considered indicative of general population exposures, this approach can be a useful tool to determine whether general population exposures exceed EPA\u2019s reference concentrations (RfCs), reference doses (RfDs), or unit cancer risks. Although biomonitoring results can be an important component of prioritization, when BEs are available for substances under consideration by the Agency, they should be used to place biomonitoring concentrations into a health risk context. Such use is consistent with the LCSA mandate for EPA to employ best available science in a risk-based framework for priority setting under TSCA.\n\nEPA should establish a criteria-based approach to narrowing the pools of candidate chemicals for prioritization that is representative of the current state of knowledge with the opportunity to update this approach to reflect new science developments. Nowhere in EPA\u2019s proposal does it reference any of the 21st Century hazard and exposure based tools that EPA might use to identify either the pools for the prioritization process or to narrow the candidates in the prioritization pool. Tools developed by EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development \u2013 such as ToxCast, ExpoCast, SHEDs-HT, etc. \u2013 hold particular promise in the near term for prioritization screening activities. Further, EPA should make certain that the databases underpinning some of its qualitative criteria are current, e.g. the Household Products Database as a source of information about presence of chemicals in consumer products. Finally, EPA should consider and review the details of risk assessments developed for other regulatory regions, such as Canada and the EU as sources for designating high and low priority chemicals.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: EPA should update and fine-tune its current TSCA Work Plan criteria (e.g. persistence and bioaccumulation; biomonitoring) and databases before implementing its prioritization process. In addition, EPA should consider the applying 21st Century tools and begin the planning needed for OCSPP to integrate these into the prioritization process when they are ready to be used for these purposes. EPA should also consider the risk assessments developed for other regulatory regions such as Canada and the EU as sources for designating high and low priority chemicals.\n\nB. EPA\u2019s Proposed Use of the Pre-Prioritization Step to Gather Information for Risk Evaluations Needs to Be Better Supported and Articulated\n\nOne of the most surprising elements of EPA\u2019s proposed prioritization process rule was the discussion of its plans to use a pre-prioritization step to gather information for risk evaluations on substances with \u201cinsufficient information\u201d for risk evaluation. EPA has authority under Section 8 of TSCA to gather existing information about chemicals and under Section 4 to develop new information when needed for risk evaluations. EPA\u2019s plan to address risk evaluation information needs, even before a chemical is prioritized, raises several significant concerns, however. First, the proposal has the potential to create \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d for data. Second, it is an unrealistic expectation for EPA to think it could know at the pre-prioritization stage what information it might need to begin gathering/requiring for risk evaluation \u2013 well before it has designated the chemical as a high priority. Finally, EPA has failed to discuss the limitations Section 4 on EPA\u2019s authority to require industry to develop new information for risk evaluations (e.g. EPA must issue statements of need). ACC\u2019s concerns are exacerbated by the fact that EPA\u2019s discussion of this proposed activity during the pre-prioritization step is vague.", "ptjf0226_p2.jpg": "3. Regulators may order Iressa off market after trial failure\n\nThe FDA is considering removing AstraZeneca's Iressa from the market after a trial showed that it was ineffective in prolonging the lives of lung cancer patients. AstraZeneca says it will not pull the drug on its own but has decided to stop promoting it. Iressa was one of the first in a new category of cancer drugs that promised to interfere with the development of a tumor without the harsh side effects associated with chemotherapy. In trials, the drug shrank tumors in 10 percent of patients who had failed to respond to other treatments. But when the FDA gave its approval to Iressa, it required a follow-up study to demonstrate that the drug prolonged patients' lives. That led to the results announced late last week and leaves Iressa with a doubtful future.\n\n4. Pharmos shares in meltdown after dexanabinol fails Phase III\n\nShares of Israel's Pharmos melted away in pre-market trading after the company announced that its lead drug candidate flunked a late-stage trial for treating severe traumatic brain injury. Researchers said that patients taking dexanabinol, which some analysts believed had blockbuster potential, did not demonstrate any significant improvement. Pharmos shares lost 77 percent of their value on the news. Pharmos has been developing compounds developed from cannabis for treating central nervous system disorders. \"We are very disappointed and frankly somewhat perplexed that we did not observe any neuroprotective effect of dexanabinol in TBI,\" said Pharmos CEO Haim Aviv. \"In the next few weeks, we will carefully analyze the results of this trial before making final decisions about our future plans, but it is unlikely that we will continue to develop dexanabinol for TBI.\"\n\nALSO: There was some good news for Pharmos, however. The company will be receiving a $10 million milestone payment from Bausch & Lomb for the eye treatment Zylet.\n\n5. Takeda suspends Phase III trial of diabetes drug\n\nJapan's Takeda has stopped a Phase III trial of its experimental diabetes drug TAK-559 after researchers received abnormal liver enzyme test results from patients taking the drug. Elevated liver enzyme results have stopped the FDA from approving other diabetes drugs. TAK-559 was being developed as a successor to Takeda's Actos, which loses patent protection in 2010.\n\nALSO NOTED\n\nTODAY'S SPOTLIGHT... Cardione touts heart drug trial data Canada\u2019s Cardione Pharma says that a Phase III trial of RSD1235 shows it was effective in restoring normal heart rhythm to 52 percent of patients suffering atrial fibrillation compared to 4 percent.", "kzbn0226_p31.jpg": "the committee discusses the charge in a public venue and also ensures that the charge is not unduly narrow. \n\nC. Comment Period on Manufacturer Requested Evaluations\n\nOnce EPA receives a manufacturer request for a risk evaluation and deems it to be valid, EPA proposes a comment period of no less than 30 calendar days. ACC is concerned that this open-ended comment period could potentially delay EPA\u2019s determinations. Based on EPA\u2019s proposal, a valid manufacturer request will need to contain all the exposure and hazard information for multiple conditions of use. The information presented will be similar to what EPA would present in a draft scoping evaluation. As such, ACC recommends that EPA align this comment period with the comment period provided for the draft scoping evaluation. ACC recommends that this be 60 calendar days and that extensions of the comment period be allowed only for particularly complex manufacturer requests.\n\nVI. The Risk Evaluation Process\n\nIn describing what the risk evaluation process will look like under the LCSA, compared to previous assessments, EPA notes that key differences include considerations of conditions of use, timelines, and determinations of unreasonable risk. While these are indeed new considerations, EPA fails to mention the importance of relying on best available science and using a WoE approach, which should incorporate systematic review practices. ACC believes that these requirements, from Section 26 of the LCSA, do indeed require a new risk evaluation process\u2014one that is much more transparent, objective and reproducible. ACC has addressed the importance of Section 26 previously in these comments and will focus in this section on the steps in the risk evaluation process.\n\nA. Scoping\n\nEPA\u2019s risk evaluation process begins with the development of the scope. In the scope, EPA intends to include the conceptual model and the analysis plan. ACC suggests that this scope also include the literature search terms and results, and a screening level risk evaluation. Consistent with systematic review approaches, discussed above, EPA should ensure that the analysis plan includes the protocol for the systematic review that will be conducted in the refined risk evaluation step.\n\nAs shown below in Figure 1, in order to ensure that the in-depth risk evaluation is focused on the conditions of use of greatest potential concern, EPA must use a tiered approach that includes a", "qtjf0226_p1.jpg": "Actos FDA Task Force: Action Plan  \nUpdate meetings daily, 5pm, Meeting Room 523  \n\nTask  \nNotes  \nLead Responsibility  \nDue Date  \n\n1.

A press release issued by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week (May 18, 2006) stated, \"If the Bulletin is not judicially reviewable, then agencies can ignore it,\" said William Kovacs, vice president of the Chamber's environment, technology & regulatory affairs division. \"What measures will OMB undertake to ensure that the agencies follow the instructions set out in the Bulletin? Unfortunately, the Bulletin lacks clarity on this important matter.\" The Chamber of Commerce is correct that OMB has been disconcertingly vague on this critical issue. Is it any wonder that Corporate America wants to increase the force of this Bulletin? It is very likely to bring regulatory actions to a stand-still, especially if outside parties like the Chamber of Commerce can bring a legal challenge against the agencies every time they step out of the straightjacket that this Bulletin places around them.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs it is now proposed, this Bulletin contains several significant weaknesses that are likely to be used by industry and the regulated community to challenge regulatory actions ad infinitum. The Bulletin imposes costly and time-consuming burdens on federal agencies to respond to challenges by outside parties. It is unnecessarily broad in its application and gives little or no deference to the judgments of the agencies which have the actual scientific expertise to conduct and evaluate risk analyses. It is unfairly burdensome to regulators while giving industry assessments a free pass. And, it pre-ordains a built-in bias against issuance of health protection on key scientific and policy issues.

The twin objectives of revenue maximisation and tobacco control have been severely compromised by this lopsided tax policy on cigarettes which now contributes over 74% of tax revenue, whilst accounting for less than 15% of tobacco consumption. Further, the tax arbitrage opportunities have fuelled the rampant growth of illegal cigarettes.\n\nThe steep hike in Excise Duty rates announced in the Union Budget 2012 will further exacerbate the problem of discriminatory and high taxation on cigarettes within the tobacco industry.\n\nThe year under review also witnessed arbitrary and steep hikes in VAT rates on cigarettes by many States. This is a complete departure from the principles of uniform VAT rates enunciated by the Empowered Committee in its White Paper on State level Value Added Tax. Further, several States continued to levy discriminatory and higher rates of VAT on cigarettes compared to other tobacco products, thereby widening the tax gap amongst tobacco products. A plethora of 29 different tax rates are currently applicable on cigarettes across States in India which has forced manufacturers to adopt State specific pricing. Not only will this result in unproductive costs in managing supply chain complexities but also lead to potential disputes in the assessment of ad-valorem taxes. The imposition of non-uniform VAT rates by States also goes against the tenets of the draft National Competition Policy, which recommends a \u2018single national market\u2019 in line with the principle that fragmented markets impede competition. In addition, the resultant attractive tax arbitrage opportunity promotes illegal inter-State diversion of stocks by unscrupulous elements thus depriving the Government of revenue and diverting trade away from legitimate distribution channels.\n\nThe findings reported in the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) India, 2009-10 study, conducted under the aegis of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, shows that whilst the consumer base of tobacco in India stands at 34.6% of all adults, the cigarette share is only 5.7%. About 75% of Indian tobacco consumers consume non-smoking tobacco products mainly in the form of oral chewing products which constitutes the single largest consumer base for tobacco products in India. It may be noted that India, with 17% of the world population, accounts for 89% of global tobacco consumption in smokeless form. Cigarette consumption in India, on the other hand, constitutes only 1.9% of global consumption. This pattern of tobacco consumption is contrary to global trends, including that of our neighbouring countries, where cigarettes are the dominant form of tobacco consumption.\n\nThe domestic legal cigarette industry is faced with the growing menace of illegal cigarettes. Independent research indicates that, in India, whilst there is a fall in volumes of \u2018duty paid\u2019 cigarettes by 4.4% during the period 2005 to 2010, the \u2018duty-not-paid\u2019 volumes grew by 49.3% during the same period. India has now been recognised as one of the leading destinations for illegal cigarettes.\n\nAttractive tax arbitrage opportunities, as a result of high level of taxes on the legal domestic cigarette industry in India, incentivises illegal flow of cigarettes into the country, especially of internationally advertised and known brands.\n\nAnother dangerous outcome of the increasing volume of illicit trade is that it encourages the entry of organised criminal syndicates, which can have serious law and order consequences for the country. Internationally, it has been reported that illegal profits from cigarette smuggling have been used to fund terrorist activities.\n\nCoupled with our porous borders, cigarette imports under Open General License (OGL) make it extremely difficult to monitor and regulate the inflow of illegal stocks. Further, with the domestic cigarette industry being strictly regulated, including compulsory licensing under the Industrial (Development & Regulation) Act, 1951, a liberal import policy is contrary to the Government\u2019s tobacco control policies. This is also detrimental to the interests of Indian tobacco farmers, as it directly impacts the demand for indigenous tobacco by the domestic industry.\n\nThe demographic construct of India\u2019s population calls for multiple price points to meet the needs of the country\u2019s diverse consumer segments. The growth of illegal cigarettes is also aided by the vacuum created at lower price points, where legal industry has been unable to operate, due to a disproportionately high tax burden. Further, the lacunae in the provisions of the Industrial (Development & Regulation) Act, 1951 encourages", "jqbn0226_p4.jpg": "Doctor, there's some letters after your name. What's the Ph.D.?\nA.

Comment Period on the Draft Scope\nACC recommends that EPA allow a period of 60 calendar days for commenting on the draft scope. EPA\u2019s proposal of 30 calendar days is far too short to allow for sufficient evaluation of hazard information, exposure information, and planned methods.\n\nFor organizations like ACC, time is needed not only for staff to review the draft document, but also to ensure coordination with multiple member companies who will be potentially impacted by the forthcoming risk evaluation. Time is needed to ensure that comments developed are not only representative, but also constructive and informative to EPA. A 30-day comment period is simply unworkable, particularly if EPA intends to include all conditions of use. EPA will likely also rely on pre-existing evaluations to inform screening level evaluations and a detailed review of this underlying information will take time. As draft scope documents will likely be complex, ACC recommends that the default comment period be 60 calendar days and that extensions of the comment period be allowed only for particularly complex scoping assessments.\n\nB. Comment Period on the Draft Risk Evaluation\nOnce the scoping evaluation is complete, EPA will likely spend two years conducting the risk evaluation. When the draft risk evaluation is complete, EPA proposes a 30 day calendar period for public comments. ACC recommends that this comment period be at least 90 calendar days. The draft risk evaluation is expected to be a complex, science and data rich evaluation that is the culmination of over two years of work by EPA staff and contractors.\n\nThis evaluation will likely also consider multiple populations, including susceptible populations as workers, and multiple exposure scenarios for each individual condition of use. The document may be made more complex by the fact that EPA may be evaluating multiple conditions of use and, as required by the LCSA, will include a detailed and transparent weight of the evidence evaluation of hazard and exposure information for each condition of use. The data and calculations presented in the document will also need to be scrutinized, and modeling results independently verified. This document will be far more complex than the scoping evaluation and sufficient time will be needed to review, coordinate, and prepare constructive comments for EPA.\n\nEPA must ensure that this public comment period occurs before the draft risk evaluation undergoes peer review as the peer reviewers should be informed by the public comments. In addition, when EPA releases the draft risk evaluation, a draft charge for the peer reviewers should also be released and made available for public comment. The final charge sent to peer reviewers should be informed by and revised, as needed, following public comment on the draft to ensure that the peer review will address areas where there is significant stakeholder disagreement. This approach is consistent with the EPA SAB staff commitment to ensuring that", "srwn0081_p4.jpg": "TSLSUM02  \n08:15:23  \n*** ANALYSES RESULTS ***  \n*** FINAL REPORT ***  \nPage 5  \n06/05/92  \n\nTest Part MA 1253 AG MA 1253 AH MA 1253 A1  \nPart Name C70 C70 C70  \nBrand Code 1001 AS 1001 AS 1001 AS  \nItem Rev 2020108 BI 2020108 BI 2020108 BI  \nSample Loc WPK WPK  \nDate(Shift) 19920515(8) 19920515(8)  \nWeekending 19920517 19920517 19920524  \nComments  \nButt Length 23.0 23.0  \n\nCHEMICAL: PROPYLENE GLYCOL & GLYCERIN TOB OR CIGS  \nPROPYLENE GLYCOL % 0.74 0.38 0.38  \nCount 2 2 2  \nStd.

The purpose of this codification is to allow injured parties an avenue to obtain relief where they have misused a product in a way that the manufacturer should have anticipated. The doctrine, however, presents many fact-based questions for a jury. Generally speaking, foreseeable misuses do not include circumstances where the hazard was clear and a plaintiff disregarded it anyway (e.g., the plaintiff decided to juggle knives knowing that they are sharp and not intended for juggling); where instructions and warnings were clear and a plaintiff disregarded them anyway; where a plaintiff had the skills, knowledge and training to act prudently and failed to do so.\n\nIn short, in tort cases, \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d is the limit of liability. Courts seek to predict reasonable and expected conduct under the specific factual circumstances presented. Here, EPA is tasked with making much the same analysis. Reasonably foreseen conduct therefore does not include illegal uses or activities, product misuses, and illegal and improper disposal. Such conditions of use are properly outside the scope of a risk evaluation.\n\nThis approach is sensible and practical. The purpose of the scoping exercise is to focus the risk evaluation. Including every conceivable scenario, regardless of substantiation, likelihood, and severity whereby someone might misuse or be injured by a chemical substance cannot be the point of a risk evaluation. Indeed, boundless approaches ignore the \u201creasonably\u201d in \u201creasonably foreseen.\u201d This approach to \u201creasonably foreseen\u201d also becomes untethered from Congress\u2019 focus on risk in risk evaluations; rather than focusing on major risks it chases minor, abstract, and even merely hypothetical ones. It undermines the point of scoping the risk evaluation to achieve this purpose, and is inconsistent with Congress\u2019 expectation set out in the legislative history that misuses are outside the scope of risk evaluations.\n\nH. EPA Must Use High Quality, Best Available Information to Identify Conditions of Use For Inclusion in Scoping.\n\nCommodity chemicals and building block chemicals may have hundreds or thousands of discrete and readily identifiable uses. In some cases, \u201cmajor\u201d intermediate and end uses of chemicals will be readily apparent from reporting already made to EPA or other credible sources of public information. Information of varying quality, integrity, credibility, and reliability is available about \u201cuses\u201d of chemicals on the internet, social media, and online journals. A significant amount of information available over the internet is from anonymous sources or anecdotal in nature. EPA should apply its Quality System to information collected and evaluated to identify conditions of use in the pre-scoping stage, and ensure that it has conducted a data assessment to verify that they are of sufficient quantity and adequate quality for their intended use (to define the scope of the risk assessment).", "nlcn0226_p11.jpg": "force agency inaction is often exactly what industry and OMB may seek to accomplish with such proposals. The tobacco industry introduced the technique of manufactured doubt as a means to deny health impacts and delay regulation of its products: \"Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also a means of establishing controversy.\" (1969 internal tobacco industry memo, stamped \"confidential\") Studies of documents from the tobacco industry archives have revealed evidence of concentrated industry efforts to obscure the contribution of secondhand smoke and other environmental toxins to disease through the development of their own version of \"good epidemiological practices\" and \"sound science,\" thereby infusing the scientific literature with \"anti-data\" intended to obfuscate scientific consensus (Ong and Glantz 2001). The OMB Bulletin stands in a long tradition of infusing uncertainty, subjecting evidence of harm to repeated challenges ad infinitum, and derailing orderly regulatory actions.\n\nOMB has not presented a compelling empirical justification for being a one-size-must-fit-all approach for all agencies. OMB insists on empirical evidence in the rulemaking process. But the Bulletin lacks any empirical evidence about the nature and extent of the problems with risk assessment practices in each of the agencies. The Bulletin only contains general pronouncements that the risk assessment process can be improved to be better understood, transparent, and more objective. Without knowing the specificity of the problems that the agencies and interested stakeholders are confronting, it becomes difficult to craft an appropriate solution or solutions. Instead of presenting empirical evidence of the problems, OMB leaped to a solution, but again it failed to provide any evidence demonstrating the efficacy of its proposed one-size-fits-all solution for all agencies.\n\nBy rushing to judgment, OMB's Bulletin would effectively force the government to engage in a vast, unwieldy experiment.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBASIS OF PREPARATION OF ACCOUNTS\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the basis of going concern, under the historic cost convention, except for certain, tangible assets which are being carried at revalued amounts. These financial statements have been prepared to comply in all material aspects with applicable accounting principles in India, the applicable Accounting standards notified under Section 211 (3C) of the Companies Act, 1956 (\"the Act\") and the relevant provisions of the Act.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as on the date of the financial statements and reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. The estimates made are based on the principles of prudence and reasonableness, however, actual results could differ from these estimates. Any revision to such accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.\n\nFIXED ASSETS\n\nTANGIBLE ASSETS\nTangible assets are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any, except so far as they relate to the revaluation of land and buildings. Historical cost is inclusive of freight, installation cost, duties and taxes, interest on specific borrowings utilised for financing the assets and other incidental expenses.\n\nDepreciation is provided on plant and machinery on straight line basis at the rates specified in Schedule XIV of the Act. On other assets, depreciation is provided on straight line basis at rates determined based on estimated useful life of assets. Such rates adopted being higher than the Schedule XIV rates as given below:\nBuildings Freehold 5%\nLeasehold Property 5%\nFurniture and Fixtures 15 - 25%\nOffice Equipment 15 - 25%\nMotor Vehicles etc. 25%\n\nAccelerated depreciation is provided based on technical evaluation of estimated useful life of an asset. All assets costing less than \u20b95,000 are fully depreciated in the year of purchase.\n\nDepreciation on the revalued assets is calculated on the revalued costs and the Revaluation Reserve is adjusted with the difference between the depreciation calculated on such revalued costs and historic costs.\n\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets are stated at cost net of accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Computer software (including license fees and cost of implementation/system integration services) is capitalised where it is expected to provide future enduring economic benefits. Cost of upgradation/enhancements is charged as revenue expenditure unless they bring similar significant additional benefits. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life. Useful life is determined based on the period of the underlying contract and the period of the intangible asset is expected to be used i.e.\nRights on time share - over 20 years\nComputer software - over 4 years\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS\nAll the fixed assets are assessed for any indication of impairment, at the end of each financial year. On such indication, the impairment loss, being the excess of carrying value over the recoverable value of the assets, is charged to the statement of profit and loss in the respective financial years. The impairment loss recognised in the prior years is reversed in cases where the recoverable value exceeds the carrying value, upon re-assessment in the subsequent years.\n\nINVESTMENTS\nLong term investments are valued at cost net of provision, for permanent diminution, if any. Current investments are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value.\n\nINVENTORIES\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is computed on weighted average method. Cost.", "kmcj0227_p0.jpg": "BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH  \nName: LaVell M.

The objective of this program is to use the relationship between nitrate rating (nitrate content of brei), yield and sucrose content to make the grower more aware of his past fertilizer management program. High nitrate contents in brei samples indicate excessive nitrogen levels in the soil. The data in Figure 1 show that as the nitrate rating increases, the sucrose percentage decreases at a rate of approximately 0.77% for every nitrate rating. The Lovell, Goodland, Longmont, Sterling and Gering factory area labs have been performing nitrate ratings on brei samples this fall. These results will be available later. The relationship in Figure 1 should be used by the agriculturists to evaluate a grower's fertilizer program and encourage him to reduce nitrogen applications if he had high nitrate ratings and low sucrose percentages.  \n\nSummary  \nDeep soil probes should be taken from prospective sugarbeet fields to a depth of five feet. From the laboratory results and consideration of past cropping history, a fertilizer recommendation can be made that will produce maximum returns. Yield responses to applied nitrogen are generally not obtained if soil N levels exceed 100 pounds per acre. Results from Colorado State University show fifty percent of the fields in Colorado can obtain residual soil nitrogen to produce a 20 ton per acre sugarbeet crop without the application of additional nitrogen fertilizer. High residual soil NO3-N levels do not go hand in hand with production of quality sugarbeets.

HKI has expanded its rehabilitation projects from two to five regions in the Philippines during the last 12 months. \n\nIn Misamis Oriental, Iloilo and Capiz Provinces, for example, HKI workers have journeyed from one outlying village to the next to conduct programs tailored to the needs of each blind person. They teach the blind everyday living skills that sighted people take for granted. Blind people learn to cook and clean. They learn to move about their villages safely. Most important, they learn vocational skills, such as raising vegetables and poultry, so they can earn a living. \n\nWithin the next decade, HKI expects to see such service programs operating in all rural villages of the Philippines, reaching the vast", "fkxn0226_p19.jpg": "Mrs. Herlihy-Paoli\u2019s Losses Diminishment in Household Services\n\n\u2022 Loss of services in the household is measured by the cost of one hour at minimum wage rate ($7.80/hour in Montana).\n\n\u2022 Based on the principle of Substitution Cost.

Procedures: (Relate directly to the Specific Aims cited in 5).\n\n1. Animals\nSprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6J mice will be housed in a controlled environment (24\u00b0C, 12 hours of light/24 hours). A synthetic diet rich in glucose will be given as a single daily meal from 0900 to 1200. Water will be available ad libitum. The animals will be allowed to adjust to the feeding schedule form at least 2 weeks before being used for experiments.\n\nExperiments with animals will conform with the \"Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals\" approved by the Council of the American Physiological Society and with federal laws and regulations.\n\n2. Acute and chronic treatments of animals with hydroxycitrate (HC)\nAcute administration of HC (0.5 mmol/kg) will be performed by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection of a stock solution of sodium salt adjusted to pH = 7.40. Chronic treatment will be performed by intraperitoneal injection one half hour before the daily meal or by mixing HC with the diet mixture (50 nmoles/kg diet).\n\n3. Effect of hydroxycitrate on brain acetylcholine synthesis\nAcetylcholine synthesis will be assayed in brains of rats and mice after chronic and acute treatment with HC. Total brain sampling will be performed using the brain blowing technique devised by Veech et al (Biochem. J. 134, 1001, 1973). In order to sample regional samples of the brain like the diencephalon where the appetite center is located, the animals will be decapitated above liquid frozen maintained at -150\u00b0 with liquid nitrogen. The brain will be dissected in the frozen state. Alternatively, brains will be coagulated by microwave irradiation of live animals.\n\nAcetylcholine will be determined by radiometric assay as described by Goldberg and McCaman (J. Neurochem. 20, 1, 1973). Acetylcholine synthesis will be measured in vitro in brain slices and in nerve cell cultures. Brain slices or isolated cells will be incubated with 14C-glucose, eserin and various concentrations of HC. 14C-acetylcholine will be isolated by the method of Goldberg and McCaman before being counted.\n\nIn addition, the activities of citrate cleavage enzyme and choline acetyl-transferase will be assayed in the brain of rats chronically treated with HC as well as in control animals.\n\n4. Effect of hydroxycitrate on the enzymes of cholesterol synthesis and cytoplasmic ketogenesis.

The administrator for the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Mr. W. S. Gaud, recently said that \"We may begin to see some marked decrease in the birth rate by the 1980s\" (italics his). The result will be a world population doubling in less than 35 years. To double the world's agricultural production in a similar period is a staggering thought for the agriculturalist.\n\nIf the developing nations are to be fed, those nations must make their own fields more productive. It is not necessary to debate here whether or not they will be able to feed themselves. But it is important for the plant scientist to recognize that the pressure to seek ever-more production out of the same land will increase constantly in the future.\n\nAgricultural development programs will urge more and more inputs (water, improved varieties, fertilizer, etc.) in order to increase unit production on lands now in use and promote the opening of new lands in areas that will subject crop plants to generally untested environments. Foreign aid efforts will increasingly try to offer these inputs and to make these colonization programs possible. This means:\n\na) greater plant populations per acre,\n\nb) greater effort to obtain two and three crops per year from the same land,\n\nc) greater pressure to shorten testing schedules of new production techniques (e.g., resistant varieties, pesticides), and\n\nd) greater use of fertilizers to maximize crop yields.\n\nThus, during the next two decades, the world will undoubtedly be in greater danger of severe epiphytotics than it has been at any time during the past two generations. Few countries have reserves on hand to offset a serious seasonal drop in food output. For a score of nations today, a poor crop in two successive years could destroy a decade of development progress.\n\nThere is nothing that could push plant pathology into the forefront of international thinking more quickly than to have a sudden loss of 20 per cent of Asia's rice crop due to a new race of Piricularia oryzae or to have", "njnp0227_p17.jpg": "16  \nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/njnp0227", "njnp0227_p4.jpg": "Desmond Heeley's design for Don Pasquale.

Yang*, D.S.H. Liu*, and A. Richardson* (SPON: G. Gorin). Illinois State University, Normal, Ill. 61761.\n\nIn vitro protein synthesis by the post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) of the cerebrum (cbr), cerebellum (cbl), and optic lobes (opl) from Leghorn chick brain differ significantly, and this difference increases with age. In vitro protein synthesis with the cbr was found to be 2-fold greater than the cbl or opl while no significant difference was observed between the cbl or opl. When the PMS of the three regions of the brain was fractionated by centrifugation into microsomes and post-microsomal supernatant (cell sap), the higher protein synthetic activity of the cbr was found to be due to both microsomal and cell sap factors. Centrifugation of the PMS of the cbr, cbl, or opl through sucrose gradients showed ribosome aggregation to mRNA was greatest for the cbr. The activity of brain ribosomes stripped of endogenous mRNA was tested in a system containing polyuridylic acid (150 \u00b5g/ml) and 14C-phenylalanine. The incorporation of 14C-phenylalanine into acid insoluble material by the ribosomes from the cbr was consistently 10-15% greater than either the cbl or opl. The three regions of the brain also exhibited different sensitivities to protranexylic acid, an inhibitor of in vitro initiation of protein synthesis. At a concentration of 50 \u00b5M, in vitro protein synthesis by the PMS from the cbr and opl was inhibited 44% and 22% respectively while no inhibition was observed in the PMS from the cbl.

ROBERT GOOD  \nat the 1977 Intra-Science Symposium  \n\nDr. Robert Good, Director of Research for the Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, discussed \"Medicine in China\" in a luncheon address to the 1977 Intra-Science Symposium on \"The Biochemistry of Aging.\" Having recently returned from three weeks in China as a guest of the Chinese Medical Society, Dr. Good presented an overview of a country in a very rapid state of cultural change. He pointed out that the last thirty years has been a time of very dramatic change in China, \"and things have happened that are as good as anything.\" The university has essentially been destroyed and the graduate students are gone. On the other hand, he noted, \"some extraordinary things have happened in medicine.\"  \n\nHe went on to say that real progress has been made in the treatment and cure of cancer in China, through their emphasis on prevention and by working with the people where they live. There are five major kinds of cancer in China, Dr. Good reported, cancer of the esophagus, the cervix, the uterus, the nasal pharynx (in the south), and the liver (in the central part).  \n\nTheir big approach to esophageal cancer, Dr. Good explained, has to do with the tremendous manpower of the Chinese medical corps, numbering 1.1 million, with about 200,000 of that number being trained by what they consider western methods, even though they have reduced their medical education from just two to three years. About 1.7 million of their medical corps consists of what they call \"barefoot doctors,\" who are basically apprentice trained, although they do have an orientation in the medical schools. The \"barefoot doctors\" work very closely with the people and handle between 200 and 300 cases each.  \n\nDr. Good reported that the \"barefoot doctors\" using a simple balloon which they inflate and then do cytological smear, are able to diagnose on a routine basis the precursor lesion and the early stages of carcinoma of the esophagus.  \n\nWith early diagnosis, the esophageal cancer can be removed, and if caught early enough they say, there are nearly ninety percent rather than five percent using conventional methods or waiting until symptoms occur.  \n\nThey relate cancer of the esophagus to several things: 1) a borderline deficiency of A and C vitamins, 2) the way they ferment their food, because they don't have refrigeration, which involves fungal infestation and very frequently the esophagus are infected by fungi, 3) there is evidence of a molybdenum deficiency in the soil in the area where there is a high frequency of esophageal cancer, and finally 4) there nitrates are in their food and water supply in carcinogenic potential.  \n\nCancer of the cervix and uterus, Dr. Good said, has been drastically reduced through control of sexual behavior, by decreasing the number of pregnancies. In addition, many \"barefoot doctors\" specialize in women's analysis and they are able to detect cancer of the cervix at a very early stage.  \n\n(Continued on the next Page)", "pxyk0226_p23.jpg": "21 (from copper gluconate) is also administered to each patient.

Improvement in energy intensity gradually reaches a sustained 2% p.a. To support a 3% p.a. growth in GDP, primary energy increases at about 1.3% p.a. until 2030, as developing economies expand. Thereafter, energy growth slows down to 1% p.a., as \"Dematerialisation\", started in the more advanced regions of OECD countries, gradually spreads to industrialising and developing countries, once infrastructure has been built and GDP per capita is high enough. Countries restructuring their economies would improve their energy efficiencies drastically.\n\nCoal and oil growth is lower in \"Dematerialisation\" than in \"Sustained Growth\". However, more gas is being used to compensate for the delayed take-off of PV solar, postponed from 2020 to 2050. This technology remains a niche application until nanotechnology becomes widely applicable!\n\nA 2% p.a. improvement in energy intensity has only been seen for limited periods in the past. In \"Dematerialisation\", relentless advances in information technology, telecommunication, materials and biotechnology would enable high energy intensity improvements to be sustained for several decades.\n\nIn \"Dematerialisation\", the rate of market penetration for identified renewable energy - wind, biomass, PV solar - is lower than in \"Sustained Growth\". The second wave of renewables is not needed until 2050.\n\nConclusions\n\n1) Hydrocarbons are needed for economic development\n2) Productivity improvement in supply and use will continue\n3) Energy needs will be met by more diverse sources\n4) \"Carbon free\" newcomers can become competitive through market mechanisms. Markets will decide which technology is best.\n5) CO2 emissions from fossil fuels peak at around 10 GtC before the middle of the next century and decline to 4GtC/year by 2100, leading to stabilisation of CO2 content in the atmosphere at about 550 - 600 ppm, according to current models, or 60% above today's level.\n\nCO2 Emission - Fossil Fuels\n\nAmong many different possible paths along which the world energy system could develop, \"Sustained Growth\" and \"Dematerialisation\" are two sustainable and plausible archetypes which could happen through market mechanisms and with minimum stimulation. These scenarios provide low economic cost options to policy makers and are genuinely \"no regret\".\n\nLike 100 years ago, there are many talents in the world. Provided governments maintain a framework in which inventiveness, competition and productivity are encouraged and rewarded and where decisions are the result of a rational and open debate, business can do a lot to support sustained economic growth, supplying and using energy in an environmentally responsible manner.", "knmk0226_p1.jpg": "Carl Byoir & Associates, Inc.\n\nCarolyn Walden, Director TV, Radio, Film Department\n\nFebruary 9, 1978\n\nMs. Julia Child \"The French Chef\" c/o WGBH-TV 125 Western Avenue Boston, Massachusetts 02134\n\nDear Ms. Child:\n\nBoy....do you have a lot of fans!

The protein intake in the U.S. generally exceeds the protein RDA; thus the tabulated value of 80g mg calcium per day for adults is maintained. However, it is acknowledged in the text that less calcium is needed by those persons consuming proteins in amounts approaching the protein RDA. Calcium balance can be attained with calcium intakes below the RDA. It is noted in the text that about 85 percent of the calcium intake in the U.S. is obtained from milk and dairy products. An additional 400 mg of calcium are needed during pregnancy and lactation. A calcium-to-phosphate dietary ratio between 2:1 and 1:2 has previously been recommended; however, ratios outside these boundaries are tolerated, provided vitamin D intake is sufficient. Except for young infants, the phosphorus RDA is identical to the calcium RDA. A calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 1.5:1 is recommended during early infancy.\n\nMagnesium. Recent studies support an allowance of 350 mg magnesium for adult males and 300 mg for adult females (1)\u2014recommendations similar to those of 1968 (2). During pregnancy and lactation an additional mg magnesium are recommended.\n\nRDA have been derived for those trace elements for which sufficient scientific evidence from human studies and nutritional and epidemiologic surveys is available. The average availability of trace elements from a balanced diet is carefully considered in formulating RDA. Concern is expressed in the text regarding trace element imbalances in the future. The habitual intake of highly refined or fabricated foods could lead to trace element deficiencies. Conversely, exposure to environments contaminated with heavy metals could be toxic. Emphasis is placed on the consumption of a varied and balanced diet to insure an adequate intake of trace elements (1,7).\n\nIron. The RDA for iron in the 8th edition has been maintained at 10 mg/day for adult males and postmenopausal females and 18 mg/day for women of childbearing age. The significant change in the 1974 RDA is the recommendation for supplemental iron (30 mg to 60 mg) for pregnant women (1).\n\nCopper. Although a RDA for copper has not been established, copper balance is maintained with intakes of 1.3 mg/day for preadolescent girls, 2 mg/day for adults, and 0.8 mg/kg/day for infants and children (1,7).\n\nIodine. An iodine intake of 1 \u00b5g/kg body weight is recommended for the prevention of goiter. Additional iodine is required by growing children and pregnant and lactating women. Iodine intake varies widely; however, to prevent deficiencies it is suggested that only iodized salt be used in the household.\n\nFluorine. Fluorine is an essential element although RDA have not been established for this nutrient. The fluoridation of public water supplies which contain an insufficient concentration of fluorine is endorsed by the Food and Nutrition Board (1).\n\nZinc. The single new addition to the 1974 RDA table is the allowance for zinc, 15 mg for adult men and women. The allowance is based on data from metabolic studies and the average zinc content of mixed diets. An allowance of 9 mg of zinc is indicated during pregnancy and 10 mg during lactation. In the Middle East, marginal zinc deficiency, as evidenced by hypogonadism, has been demonstrated in man. In the U.S., however, the average zinc intake exceeds the RDA. Increased zinc intake by persons with high dietary fiber has accelerated wound healing and improved taste acuity (1).\n\nChromium. Although a RDA for chromium has not been established, it is essential for man. This trace element probably acts as a cofactor for insulin. Marginal deficiencies of chromium in selected populations are suspect (1).\n\nOTHER NUTRIENTS\nOther nutrients not included in the table but discussed in the text are: water, vitamin K, biotin, choline, pantothenic acid, sodium, potassium, chloride, and trace elements such as cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, nickel, tin, vanadium, and silicon (1).\n\nAcknowledgments The National Dairy Council assumes the responsibility for the publication.

Our test product will be pasteurized and not fermented, as is Revel. Our initial research has shown consumer interest, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to test market to learn more.  \nQ: Where does the tobacco come from?  \nA: For competitive reasons, we can\u2019t discuss that.  \nQ: Why aren\u2019t you pursuing the moist snuff category, which has a proven track record, rather than trying to carve out a niche with no U.S. demand?  \nA: Our snus is moist snuff \u2013 with a difference; it is pasteurized, comes in a pouch and is spitless. This is a test market to generate learning.  \nQ: Who is the expected consumer for Camel Snus? Smokers? Moist snuff users?  \nA: We expect interest from both adult smokers and moist snuff users. That\u2019s the reason for the test markets. We may find that snus use and smoking are interchangeable \u2013 adult tobacco users may smoke at times and when they don\u2019t or can\u2019t smoke, they may snus. That\u2019s part of what we hope to learn in the test.  \nQ: Are you concerned about cannibalism of your current smokers, especially Camel smokers?  \nA: We may find that snus use and smoking are not exclusive of one another \u2013 adult tobacco users may smoke at times and when they don\u2019t or can\u2019t smoke, they may snus. That\u2019s part of what we hope to learn in the test.  \nQ: Are profit margins from snus, for which you will have to pay contract manufacturing fees, special packaging fees, transcontinental transportation, special storage fees for refrigerated facilities, etc. going to be anywhere close to those of moist snuff products or cigarettes?  \nA: That would be competitive information that we would not discuss.  \nQ: Does your test marketing of snus preclude you from making an acquisition in the smokeless category? Does this mean you are more interested in organic growth versus growth by acquisition?  \nA: No, this test market does not preclude other opportunities. We have consistently said that we would evaluate opportunities within the tobacco category provided they would be accretive to earnings and are businesses to which we believed we could bring value. The Camel Snus test market doesn\u2019t change that.  \nQ: Can you give us some basic background facts: size of snus market in Sweden and its historical growth there? Recent growth trends in the U.S. moist snuff market?  \nA: There are one million users of snus in Sweden. The nation has slightly more than 9 million total population. More people in Sweden use snus than smoke.  \nQ: Is snus considered a \u201cgateway\u201d product in Sweden?", "ysbd0227_p1.jpg": "CRITERIA FOR THE ALLOWANCE OF TRAVEL EXPENSES TO CHAIRMEN, VICE CHAIRMEN AND INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF PANELS AS ESTABLISHED FOR THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON FOOD, NUTRITION AND HEALTH\n\nI.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS A. Definition of Death As a concomitant of technological advances in the field of medicine, there has emerged the problem of determining, for numerous purposes, whether and when a person has died. When heart transplants were made feasible, it became evident that the traditional test - cessation of respiration and heartbeat - would no longer be universally valid. At this point in time, the Heart Association Committee on Ethics endorsed the concept of brain death - i.e., a person is dead when he or she has suffered an irreversible cessation of spontaneous brain function. Legislation and case law on this matter is, however, still confused. In order to rectify this situation, the Heart Association would favor: State legislation defining death in neurological terms.", "rjcd0227_p0.jpg": "HUMAN DEVELOPMENT DIVISION\n\nINSTITUTO DE NUTRICION DE CENTRO AMERICA Y PANAMA  \nOFICINA SANITARIA PANAMERICANA  \nOFICINA REGIONAL DE LA ORGANIZACION MUNDIAL DE LA SALUD  \nAPARTADO 11-88 GUATEMALA, C.

This body could act as a coordinator and insure that general programs are tailored to meet specific country needs.  \n\nWith respect to particular facets of the problem of lack of nutrients in the diet, the following suggestions were offered:  \n\n1. Lack of protein availability should be attacked by supplementation or fortification, depending on what is available under the circumstances.  \n\n2. Incentives should be producer oriented, and U.S. industry participation should be part of the total concept. Perhaps this participation could be in the form of a consortium. However, it should be kept in mind that local governments require incentives also.  \n\n3. Lack of food standards should be approached both from the need for fortification and enrichment regulations and from the problem of handling and utilization of wastes.  \n\n4. U.S. type protein rich foods should not be discouraged.  \n\n5. Within a particular country the pilot project approach should receive priority since it can serve as a showcase of tangible results.

Nicotine in gas and particulate phases, solanesol, aldehydes, 3-ethenylpyridine, CO, CO2, O3, RSP, temperature and pressure were measured in the smoking section and at three locations in the non-smoking section with the PASS samplers. Nicotine and cotinine were measured in the total urine samples of the passengers who operated the samplers for the time period extending 24 hours before the flight to 48 hours after the flight. Atmospheric samples were also collected to determine the personnel\u2019s exposure to nicotine during the same time period. This study concluded that the rate of penetration of ETS species from smoking to non-smoking sections followed first order mechanism, cotinine in urine was highly correlated with nicotine, nicotine disappeared more rapidly in the cabin air than RSP, CO and NO, probably due to the adsorption by the fabrics, and for the passengers in the non-smoking section, more exposure to nicotine occurred in the airport than in the aircraft cabin.\n\nA separate study concerning nicotine in ETS by P. R. Nelson (R. J. Reynolds Tobacco) showed a different decay phenomenon. With a controlled environmental chamber, 1R4F Kentucky reference cigarettes, and real-time and discreet analyses, the ratios between the concentrations of nicotine and other selected ETS constituents such as CO, CO2, NO, pyridine, solanesol, RSP and total hydrocarbons were calculated up to six hours following the smoking. The wide variation of the ratios was caused by the decay of nicotine at a different rate than other ETS components. The data also indicated that nicotine tended to linger in the environment longer than other ETS constituents due to the adsorption and re-evaporation involving the chamber wall. Exposure to ETS solely based on nicotine concentration may be overestimated and exposure to nicotine while other ETS constituents are absent is possible.\n\nOther talks in this session included a pilot field study from Battelle Institute by measuring PAH\u2019s associated with smoking, heating and cooking systems in residential air; a comparative study of PASS and personal sampling methods for nicotine in ETS by W. E. Crouse of Lorillard Tobacco; and a Yale University study concerning the sources of aerosol mass and inorganic elements in indoor air. The Battelle data came from a very small sample size (eight homes) and appeared to be biased, in my opinion, to single out cigarette smoke. The Lorillard study, conducted in 20 restaurants, found that PASS cases provided nicotine concentration consistently and significantly higher (p<0.02) than that from the personal sampler. Several speculative reasons, pending for additional study, were given. The Yale study correlated smoking with aerosol mass, chlorine, potassium, bromine and cadmium. No explanations were given as to the possible precursors for these elements.\n\nThis memo reported only the highlights of a selected number of papers presented at the conference.

A series of galleries is devoted to European and American art of the 16th-19th centuries by such masters as Reynolds, Delacroix, Stuart, Homer, Peale and Copley. Hawaii-inspired art by Choris and Dampier has a logical place. Separate sections are arranged with vintage furniture, silverware and china.\n\nAbove: English painting and decorative arts, 18th century.\nBelow: Sculpture garden, paved area.\n\nYou see treasures of pre-Biblical age in a corridor of Mediterranean art. The museum's dramatic contemporary collection is housed in the wing gallery, while in the intimate Academy Theatre downstairs lectures, films and special events are presented. When the wing was opened a gallery for Arts of the Pacific, Africa and the Americas, including Hawaiian Island crafts, was established off Kinau Court. The U-shaped upper floor of the Academy proper is used for changing exhibitions through the year. Late 1978 showings include Tsutsumu \u2013 The Art of the Japanese Package, jointly organized by Japan House and the American Federation of Arts, September 24-November 5, and Art Hawaii, the Academy's 28th annual exhibition honoring island artists, through December. One section contains the Ukiyo-e Center, a showcase for the James A. Michener Collection of Japanese woodblock prints. Ukiyo-e, (floating world pictures) is an esteemed and influential genre art practiced by many true masters for 250 years. With all these attributes it is fitting that the Honolulu Academy of Arts is a designated National Historic Place. And one final item: It's all free to the public.

By Kathy Smith Each owner who purchases a condominium automatically becomes a member of the \"Association of Owners.\" You are then bound by the decisions of the majority of your co-owners. This governing body meets at least annually (according to the by-laws of each association) to conduct the business of the condominium - most importantly, the election of the board of directors. In most cases, the board then elects officers from among its members. The duties of the board may vary with the by-laws. Generally, at least in Hawaii, the by-laws state that the board shall hire a managing agent, which is to be a Hawaiian corporation, to do the management duties. The duties of the managing agent usually consist of preparing working budgets, hiring the on-site personnel, including the resident manager, collecting maintenance fees and disbursing funds. MAINTENANCE FEES - These are the payments made by each and every owner of a unit within the condominium. They are used to pay utilities, payroll for on-site people, buy fertilizer, tools and other operating supplies, and very importantly, to build a reserve for that day when the building needs painting or re-roofing. They are usually paid on the first of the month, with many associations charging a late fee to those owners who do not pay on time. Both maintenance fees and special assessments are a legal obligation of the owner to the association, and failure to pay will usually result in a lien being placed on the property. Maintenance fees can be held down by a number of factors, and managing agents is some of the following ways: - All common area costs should be on pool timers; Pool motors should also be on timers, and you may be able to compensate for more or less usage; Contracts for services such as sewage treatment, plant maintenance and fire service should be reviewed and re-bid periodically; - Insurance is a necessity for both cost and adequacy of coverage. Your managing agent, board of directors and owners must work together to insure the smooth working relationship necessary for an economically well-run and efficient condominium project.", "kzng0227_p21.jpg": "Sodium  \nmg/100g  \nMax.

Financial support comes from member companies who pay a basic membership fee and contribute to the support of the ILSI activities.\n\nILSI is recognized as a non-governmental organization by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This status allows ILSI to attend meetings of the Codex Alimentarius Commission and meetings of committees of the Commission, and to participate in the activities of the International Programme of Chemical Safety and its subsidiary Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.\n\nILSI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C. Certain activities are administered through offices in Canada, West Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nBoard of Members\n\nThe Board of Members is composed of one representative of each member company. This Board recommends the establishment of Technical and Expert Committees.\n\nThe Board of Members elects the Board of Trustees and develops program guidelines for the operation of Technical and Expert Committees.\n\nBoard of Trustees\n\nThe Board of Trustees is composed of an equal number of industry and non-industry representatives plus legal counsel. Non-industry representatives may include university scientists, foundation members and government officials. The Board of Trustees is the chief administrative body of ILSI.\n\nThe primary functions of the Board of Trustees are to oversee the administration of the Institute, authorize formation of committees and sponsor other activities which enable ILSI to function effectively as a positive force in the resolution of international scientific questions. The Board of Trustees also elects the Executive Committee which consists of the President, two Vice Presidents, and a Secretary/Treasurer. The Executive Committee administers the daily affairs of the Institute.\n\nCommittees\n\nWithin ILSI there are two types of committees: Technical Committees and Scientific Expert Committees. Both generate and disseminate scientific information on national and international questions of interest to the members, but each committee has its own set of objectives and membership format.", "nmcd0228_p26.jpg": "- 24 -\nTable 1\nACUTE TOXICITY OF SODIUM SACCHARIN\nLD50 g/kg\nSpecies          Oral     I.

Rather than learning about environmental issues, and the scientific basis for environmental concerns, children are spoon-fed apocalyptic visions of a devastated planet and the need for ever-expanding government controls. Two parents who have had enough are Michael Sanera and Jane Shaw, authors of Facts, Not Fear, a new guide to environmental misinformation directed at children that tells parents what to do about it. Sanera and Shaw have surveyed dozens of textbooks, analyzing the presentation of environmental issues from deforestation and natural resource depletion to air pollution and global warming. In most areas they found existing classroom and other children's materials wanting.

CO2 emissions would grow 32% above 1990 levels by 2010 - slightly less than the 44% growth that would occur without the treaty - because of growth of emissions in developing countries like China, Mexico and India. By 2020, emissions would grow by nearly 60% even if the U.S., Europe, Japan and other industrialized nations comply with the Kyoto requirements.  \nContact: Jay Hakes or Mary Hutzler at (202) 586-2222  \n\nStudy: Argonne National Laboratory  \nFor: Department of Energy  \nDate: February 1997  \nThe Argonne Study concluded that policy restrictions on six energy intensive industries in developed countries, but not their less developed trading partners, would result in significant adverse impact. Furthermore, the study finds emissions would not be reduced significantly. The main effect of the policy would be to redistribute output, employment and emissions from developed countries to developing countries who are not required to participate.  \nContact: Harvey Drucker at (630) 252-3804 or Bill Wicker at (202) 586-5806  \n\nStudy: WEFA, Inc.  \nFor: Industry Groups  \nDate: April 1998  \nWEFA estimates that a carbon fee of $265 per metric ton would be required by late next decade to reduce emissions to the Kyoto Protocol's levels, resulting in (1) Total output reduction of 3.2% or $300 billion (in 1992$) or $2700 per family; (2) Loss of more than 2.4 million jobs; (3) a competitive advantage for advanced developing countries that are not required to participate; and (4) Sharply higher gasoline (65 cents per gallon) and gas and electricity prices (double).  \nContact: Mary Novak at (781) 221-0340  ", "lfgl0228_p1.jpg": "Study: Charles River Associates  \nFor: American Automobile Manufacturers Association  \nDate: November 1997  \n\nBased on achieving 1990 levels, Charles River estimates that, by 2010, a $177 per ton carbon tax will be needed to meet emissions caps, causing price increases for natural gas (46%), electricity (23%) and heating oil (45%).

Harder  \nJames W. McKee, Jr.  \n\nThe year 1969 was the first under our new name CPC International Inc.\n\nRecord net sales and improved earnings were achieved. Earnings per share were $2.42, compared with $2.35 the previous year. In July, the company paid its 200th consecutive quarterly dividend.\n\nThis Annual Report reviews 1969 progress of Corn Industrial, Best Foods, CPC Development, CPC/Europe, CPC/Latin America, and CPC/Far East. The three overseas operations represent businesses carried on by local affiliates in each area. The Report also summarizes general corporate activities.\n\nHighlighting accomplishments last year in the United States: Hellmann\u2019s and Best Foods mayonnaise and Skippy peanut butter set record sales and profits. Several businesses of CPC Development also achieved sales and earnings highs, with significant gains by B. P. Chemicals, a manufacturer of medicinal and industrial chemicals. Sales of Corn Industrial\u2019s line of specialty products is increased. But this component, which serves more than 600 basic industries, experienced generally higher operating costs, which affected earnings. Although corn syrup and dextrose prices stabilized, profit margins on many starch-based industrial products deteriorated. Consequently, our return on investment for Corn Industrial during 1969 was less than goal and below the 1968 level. We have restructured our marketing and sales forces to meet more specifically the needs of today\u2019s changing markets.\n\nAbroad, we achieved record sales and profits, despite unfavorable economic conditions in several countries. Long-established financial practices enabled us to minimize the adverse effects of devaluation in France, revaluation in Germany, and severe inflation in several Latin American countries. CPC/Europe further broadened Knorr\u2019s product line distribution in 1969, as demand for Knorr soups and cubes continued to rise. European operations are expected to benefit from new product introductions over the past six years. Our experience demonstrates that as the economies of countries strengthen, their affluence grows, and as eating patterns develop higher sophistication, we are able to enter additional markets with such proven product lines as Hellmann\u2019s and Knorr. This strengthened our consumer businesses in Japan, the Philippines, and several Latin American countries during the year.\n\nCapital expenditures for 1969 were $42.8 million, which were below the 1968 figure. Capital expenditures for 1970 will be somewhat higher than 1969, shared about evenly between U.S. and abroad. We will be periodically reviewing these expenditures during the year. About one-third of this total will be spent for facilities and equipment to introduce new products and develop others; another third will finance plant expansion to keep pace with customer demand for existing products; while the remainder will be used to modernize existing facilities and to replace worn equipment.\n\nOur company today markets products in 37 countries and the United States. In the 1970\u2019s we will extend distribution of selective existing products into presently established markets, as well as expand into new and untapped geographical areas; we will increase our emphasis on introducing specialty products promising more favorable return on investment; we will broaden our base through related new businesses; and we will improve our return on present product lines by reducing operating costs, where possible, or by eliminating or reducing our investment in those areas which fail to meet expectations.\n\nWe are moving forward to implement this plan for growth, while adapting to changing business conditions and to a changing environment, which demands increasing corporate social involvement.\n\nOf course, the ultimate success of our diverse multinational operations depends upon the skills, leadership, and dedication of our 43,600 employees. We appreciate their efforts and rely on their cooperation and support.\n\nManagement has a responsibility to help our employees better themselves, giving them the opportunity to grow and innovate in their present jobs and to move on to more responsible positions.\n\nWe wish to thank our shareholders for their loyalty to our products and for their suggestions offered in the interest of CPC International. We look forward to your continued constructive interest.\n\nHoward C. Harder  \nChairman and  \nChief Executive Officer  \n\nJames W.

Our target group includes all adult tobacco consumers.\n\nGeneral - Product\n\nQ: How do you use Camel Snus?  \nA: Simply slip the packet in the side of your mouth between the lip and gum. A single pouch can last up to one hour. In focus-group testing, adult consumers told us the preferred amount of time to keep the packet in their mouth was anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes.\n\nQ: Is Camel Snus like Skoal or other smokeless tobacco products?  \nA: No it is not. Unlike those products, Camel Snus does not require the consumer to spit. Additionally, Camel Snus is not available in a loose format. It\u2019s also made differently. It has less salt and less moisture content that other moist snuff. It is also pasteurized, while most moist snuff is fermented.\n\nQ: Can you swallow your saliva/snus packet?  \nA: Unlike other smokeless tobacco products, Camel Snus does not require the consumer to spit, so you can swallow the saliva.\n\nQ: What does it taste like? How long do you keep it in your mouth?  \nA: It has a tobacco taste. People usually keep a pouch in the mouth from 10 to 30 minutes.\n\nQ: How many do people typically use in a day?  \nA: That is difficult to predict as tobacco use varies by consumer.", "kgjl0226_p0.jpg": "ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE MEETING\n\nFebruary 6th, 1930\n\nAGENDA\n\n1.

NIH extramural activities cover the Research Grant, Regional Medical program, Research Fellowship, Training Grant, Research Career, Research Facility, and National Library of Medicine programs. IMPAC is a computer-based system which:\n\n1. Serves as the primary authoritative reporting system on NIH extramural activities;\n\n2. Participates in and records the extramural activities of NIH, about which a data base is developed;\n\n3. Assists in the processing of project applications submitted in the extramural programs through the review and award processes of NIH.\n\nDESIGN OBJECTIVES\nIMPAC is a system, the primary objective of which is the establishment and maintenance of a data base from which complete, accurate, and up-to-date reports to all levels of management can be generated. To establish such a data base, it was necessary to integrate data processing with the processing of the review and award operations of the National Institutes of Health. In this manner, IMPAC builds the required data base while it provides each initial review group and advisory council with the necessary documents and reports required prior to and subsequent to each step in the award review process. Similarly, the award notices as well as peripheral supporting documents are prepared by IMPAC and from the Institutes for issuance. The continuing interaction which occurs between IMPAC and the review and award processes ensures the development of a complete, accurate, and timely data base.", "yldg0072_p0.jpg": "AGENDA FOR INTRODUCTION TO ALPHA PROGRAM\n\nPRODUCT\n20 Min. \u2022 Evolution of the Cigarette and Introduction to the Alpha Concept and Components A.

Some of the centers were visited by both pediatricians, the two graduate nurses and one male attendant. Visits were made according to a prearranged schedule which had been circulated to all the Senior Medical Officers in all districts of the country and to UNRWA headquarters one month before the start of every quarter of work.\n\nThe team leader invited the physician in charge of the Maternal and Child Health or Child Health clinic, where the survey was to be done, to attend the survey and share in the discussion of the nutrition problems or diseases met. The Maternal and Child Health nurse or health worker in charge of the center and some of her assistants helped in all the surveys. In many instances the public health nurse in charge of the particular district also attended and took part in the survey activities.\n\nThe graduate nurse registered the patient and recorded the identification data, the obstetric history, past history and dietary history, often in cooperation with the public health nurse. The physician examined the children, recorded the information on the card, and took the blood specimens. The male attendant collected the urine specimens.\n\nThe specimens of blood were put in specially prepared vacutained tubes; urine was collected in plastic cups and then filtered into a special plastic bottle, the cups and bottles previously having been rinsed with distilled water. The blood and urine specimens were then placed in a portable ice box and were either sent on the same day directly to the laboratory or kept in an electric refrigerator until the next morning when they were sent to the laboratory.\n\nDespite the fact that the clinics were well bay clinics, it should be noted that at least a few mothers brought their children to the center for treatment rather than prophylaxis. Most of the children came from lower middle and low income families. The TONS estimates that these represented 75 percent of the population of the country as a whole; there are no data which allow affirmation of these figures, so that the estimates can be regarded as but an impression. Data on local conditions were not available.\n\nWherever no Maternal and Child Health or Child Health existed in the location visited, the Government Children's Clinic was visited; here people had been told beforehand of the purpose of the visit in order that they might bring their well children and not just their sick children. However, most of the centers visited were Maternal and Child Health centers.\n\nThe refugee children examined were all registered by UNRWA, and were living in refugee camps.

As a result, recharging an air-conditioner with a new refrigerant, which cost between $20 and $40 as recently as 1991 (and just a few dollars for do-it-yourselfers), currently averages about $100. This figure will increase, possibly doubling by 1996, if CFC-12 costs continue their present trends.\n\nRetrofitting vehicle air conditioners to use refrigerants other than CFCs is possible, but also expensive. Changing a CFC-using air-conditioner to use HFC-134a (thus far the leading CFC substitute) requires the replacement of several components, as well as a thorough flushing of the system to remove all traces of CFC-12 and mineral oil. The average cost of a retrofit is over $400, and there are unanswered questions about their reliability and performance. It is unlikely that many consumers will choose the retrofit option, unless CFC-12 becomes prohibitively expensive or totally unavailable.\n\nThe costs for existing vehicles will be obvious to most consumers. The costs for new vehicles will be much less so. New car and truck air-conditioners are now designed to use HFC-134a. Introduced in a few models in 1992 and 1993, HFC-134a air-conditioners will predominate in 1994 models. The auto industry has spent several hundred million dollars to redesign vehicle air-conditioning systems and retool assembly lines to accommodate the changes. Some also question the long-term reliability of HFC-134a air conditioners.\n\nEventually, these costs will be passed on to consumers in one form or another. Of course the phaseout will impact consumers in other ways as well \u2014 for instance, in the cost of refrigerators. There are approximately 150 million refrigerators in domestic use in the U.S. Nearly too early to determine the price of these new refrigerators, at least one introduced early model is priced $100 higher than a comparable CFC refrigerator, most of which range from $500 to $1,500, depending on the brand name and features. Assuming a $50 to $100 increase per refrigerator, the nearly 10 million domestic refrigerators (and standalone freezers) sold each year will cost an additional $0.5 to $1.1 billion.\n\nESTIMATED COSTS ON REFRIGERATION AND AIR-CONDITIONING 1994 through 2003 (figures in $ billions)\n\nCost Range\nVehicle Air-Conditioners 28.0 - 42.0\nIncreased Energy Consumption 0.0 - 32.1\nDomestic Refrigerators 4.0 - 8.0\nCommercial Refrigerators 3.0 - 5.4\nHCFCs 4.4 - 5.0\nHCFC Equipment 5.1 - 6.9\nTOTAL 44.5 - 99.4\n\nNote: The following are not included in the above analysis: refrigerated transportation, industrial refrigeration, medical and laboratory equipment, dehumidifiers, vending machines, water coolers, drinking fountains.\n\nevery household has at least one. They are reasonably priced and extremely reliable, often providing 15 or more years of trouble-free service. Until recently, nearly all used CFC-12 as their refrigerant. The phaseout will have relatively little effect on existing refrigerators, as less than 5 percent ever require servicing due to refrigerant leakage.\n\nAs with vehicle air-conditioners, the alternative of choice for new domestic refrigerators is HFC-134a.

The problem of malnutrition and the potential solutions that have been proposed require a close working relationship and understanding among several disciplines. AID can serve as the catalyst for cooperative action by sponsoring and participating in international work sessions which bring together the many components-- biochemists, food technologists, industry and marketing experts, government representatives, nutritionists, agriculturists, etc. A great deal of information is available to each of the fields, and an important step at this time is to ensure that it is efficiently pooled and coordinated. Since each country in a region cannot usually afford the personnel and monetary resources required for various support facilities such as training centers, food testing centers, etc., international workshops can serve to promote regional cooperation in program planning and implementation. International workshops are planned as follows in FY 68 and 69, with estimated WOI costs:  \n   1968  \n   Latin America (1) $34,000  \n   NESA - CENTO Countries (1) 10,000  \n   Africa (2) 80,000  \n   SE Asia ---  \n   $124,000  \n   1969  \n   Latin America (1) $40,000  \n   NESA - CENTO Countries ---  \n   Africa (2) 80,000  \n   SE Asia (1) 65,000  \n   $185,000  \nFunds will cover per diem and travel for foreign participants and U.S. and other lecturers and assistants, and other logistical support such as costs for room rentals, simultaneous translation, printing of reports, etc.  \ne. WOI requires flexibility to determine choice of workshop locations, dependent on progress being made or special developments in the various nutrition-related fields.  \nf. The 1968 programmed conference in Lima, Peru, September 24-30, will be the Fifth Conference on Malnutrition in the Americas under the \"Operation Ninos\" program. Valuable exchanges have taken place, awareness and urgency of the problem has been created, and programs to develop low-cost nutritious foods have evolved. This program was originally initiated by the central office of Material Resources and was turned over to the LA Bureau after 2 \u00bd years. In a stage of transition now, the Bureau has requested WOI assistance in implementing the program. The FY 1968 workshop is being jointly financed by the Latin America Bureau and WOI.", "qnwd0227_p18.jpg": "TABLE 2  \nMean Nutrient Intake for Men Sixty Years of Age and Over by Ethnic Groups in Low Income and High Income ratio States - Ten State Nutrition Survey (1968-1970)  \n\nWhite  \nBlack  \nSpanish American  \nLow Income  \nHigh Income  \nLow Income  \nHigh Income  \nLow Income  \nHigh Income  \n\nNumber of Persons  \n189  \n401  \n166  \n47  \n43  \n21  \n\nCalories  \n1937  \n2181  \n1508  \n1833  \n1812  \n1826  \n\nProtein (Gm)  \n77.6  \n88.8  \n64.4  \n75.1  \n78.2  \n77.7  \n\nCalcium (Gm)  \n0.870  \n0.811  \n0.540  \n0.605  \n0.462  \n0.874  \n\nIron (mg)  \n12.2  \n15.0  \n10.6  \n11.1  \n13.7  \n11.7  \n\nVitamin A (IU)  \n5,138  \n5,341  \n5,028  \n4,086  \n3,354  \n3,046  \n\nThiamine (mg)  \n1.17  \n1.17  \n1.01  \n1.25  \n1.25  \n1.28  \n\nRiboflavin (mg)  \n1.86  \n1.79  \n1.75  \n1.41  \n1.71  \n1.83  \n\nNiacin (mg)  \n16.15  \n22.29  \n15.04  \n14.52  \n23.80  \n12.79  \n\nVitamin C (mg)  \n57.8  \n62.8  \n56.1  \n45.5  \n50.6  \n54.5  ", "grmp0227_p13.jpg": "VISITING COMMITTEES\n\nDepartment of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAngus N.

AHA endorsed strict enforcement of manufacturing standards for devices in widespread use.  \n\nSeptember 1973 Published statement on proposed legislation for protection of human subjects in research. Emphasis was that the last thing needed was an additional federal bureaucracy for policing this area.  \n\nOctober 1973 Provided all Affiliates with guidelines on the new National Research and Demonstration Center program sponsored by the National Heart and Lung Institute (NHLI).  \n\nDecember 1973 Requested the Federal Trade Commission to bring action against the National Commission on Egg Nutrition to make NCEN stop advertising that there was no scientific evidence linking cholesterol and heart disease.  \n\nJanuary 1974 First AHA Public Policy Reference Paper presented to Board of Directors for ratification.  \n\nFebruary 1974 Objected to Medicare and Medicaid proposals which would have discouraged emergency admissions since they would have negated our \"early warning signs\" program.  \n\nMarch 1974 Obtained $50,000 from Health Services Administration to develop new CPR training materials.  \n\nApril 1974 Endorsed concept of special national panel to review and reinforce the federal commitment to biomedical research.  \n\nMay 1974 Testified before the Health Appropriations Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, recommending a $365 million budget for NHLI for fiscal year 1975.  \n\nJune 1974 Issued statement on national health insurance. Any expanded third-party payment system should include regular health audits and medication for hypertension and rheumatic fever. National health insurance should also cover patient education, rehabilitation and home health services.  \n\nIssued statement on new health planning legislation. Voluntary health agencies should be heavily involved in the decision-making process of the new program and demonstration funds should be meaningful in scope.  \n\nTelegrammed statement on proposal to give hypertension revenue sharing money to state health departments. AHA stated its recognition of the need for additional funds in this area but suggested that the most cost-effective use of the monies should rely heavily on Heart Association expertise in this area.  \n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/jzhd0227", "nsfm0227_p2.jpg": "- Scholarships, fellowships, awards and loans - as noted in this brochure - are administered by The American Dietetic Association and The American Dietetic Association Foundation.\n\n- The selection of the scholarship, fellowship and loan recipients is made by The Awards, Scholarship and Loan Fund Board of the Association.

Yet the Indian economy posted a remarkable recovery not only in terms of overall growth but also more importantly in terms of its fundamentals which justify belief in India's promising future. The Indian economy's escape from the global financial contagion was mainly due to robust foundations, and its banking sector remaining largely unexposed to risk assets, has been financed in advanced economies. The lending trend has focused on deposit-based banking as opposed to being based on banks' short-term borrowings from capital markets.\n\nThe economy is expected to grow by 8.7% in 2010-11, with a return to a growth rate of 9% in 2011-12. This outlook would be based on an escalation in investment demand, signs of recovery in the global economy and the positive effects of carrying out critical fiscal reforms such as the Goods and Service Tax (GST) and broader direct tax reforms by 2010-11 to fuel growth. In fact the optimists predict that the economy will soon breach the double digit growth mark to become one of the fastest growing economies of the world.\n\nTOBACCO INDUSTRY\n\nThe Economic Survey 2009-10 indicated that with growth in private expenditure on food, beverages and tobacco falling behind the overall growth in private consumption expenditure, the share of expenditure on food items has gradually been declining over the years. As per the CSO (Central Statistical Organisation) data, the share of private expenditure for food, beverages and tobacco was 35.3% (2006-09) of total private consumption. This is a decline from 39.6% in 2004-05.\n\nAfter registering a growth of around 14% annually in the eight-year period ending 2008-09, the category of beverages and tobacco products experienced a decline of 2.2% in 2009-10 (Apr-Nov). Cigarette production has not shown any significant growth since then, under increasing burdensome taxation and an increasingly restrictive regulatory environment.\n\nImpact of Taxation\n\nUnion Budget 2010-11 increased excise duties on cigarettes by about 18%, further pressurizing volume growth, affecting product pricing and impacting consumer behaviour, particularly since cigarette consumption, unlike other tobacco consumption, is price elastic. The consequent increase in the shift in cigarette consumption to cheaper alternatives that have higher taxation levels. Coupled with the existing rise in VAT on cigarettes from 12.5% to 20% in state budgets, this has another discriminatory blow for the cigarette segment.\n\nDue to various issues remaining unresolved amongst various stakeholders, the earlier deadline of April 01, 2010 for GST implementations stands postponed. The State Finance Ministers continues consultations on compensation to states, subsumed taxes, Constitutional amendments and model legislation for GST, amongst other issues.", "hnhp0000_p0.jpg": "RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company\n\nFax Message\n\nTO: MIKE WASHO / 1146  \nDATE: 6/6/96  \nSUBJECT: STATE MINIMUM FOR PRIVATE LABEL  \nTOTAL PIECES FAXED: 1 (INCLUDING COVER)  \n\nDEAR MIKE:  \nPER LANNY WOLFE -  \nFOLLOWING ARE FORMULAS FOR STATE MINIMUMS - PRIVATE LABEL  \n\nLIST PRICE PER 1,000 CIGARETTES X .98 (IS THE SAME AS DEDUCTING 2%)  \nADD TAX PER 1,000 CIGARETTES (NJ IS $20 PER 1,000) THAT TOTAL X 1.06  \nDIVIDED BY 5 = STATE MINIMUM DELIVERED WHOLESALE PRICE.  \n\nLIST PRICE PER 1,000 CIGARETTES X .98 (IS THE SAME AS DEDUCTING 2%)  \nADD TAX PER 1,000 CIGARETTES (NJ IS $20 PER 1,000) THAT TOTAL X 1.06 X 1.08  \nDIVIDED BY 5 = STATE MINIMUM DELIVERED RETAIL PRICE.  \n\nFran  \nFran Rhode", "gsgj0223_p90.jpg": "(v) MARKET PRICE DATA: PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON TO BROAD BASED INDICES: Monthly High and Low Quotations during the year.

For most of that time, the target of this effort has been the smoker. Recently, however, the emphasis has undergone a major shift. Today there are scientists who claim that cigarette smoke in the air can actually cause disease in non-smokers. We hear a great deal about \"second-hand smoke\" and \"passive smoking.\" But is this new approach wholly motivated by concern for the non-smoker, or is it the same old war on smoking in a new guise? These doubts are raised when we recall statements like the following, by a spokesperson for the American Lung Association: Probably the only way we can win a substantial reduction [in smoking] is if we can somehow make it nonacceptable socially.... We thought the scare of medical statistics and opinions would produce a major reduction. It really didn't. Obviously, one way to make smoking \"nonacceptable socially\" would be to suggest that second-hand smoke could cause disease. So it is not surprising that we are now seeing a flurry of research seeking scientific support for these suggestions.\n\nMany independent experts believe the scientific evidence on passive smoking is questionable. But a zealous group of anti-smokers are using this issue in their campaign against tobacco as if the claims were established scientific fact. We deplore the actions of those who try to manipulate public opinion through scare tactics. As the late, respected pathologist, Dr. H. Russell Fisher, stated in testimony submitted to a Congressional hearing on passive smoking: \"[I]n the absence of any scientific proof of harm from atmospheric tobacco smoke, we are dealing with a social question and not a medical one. In this regard it should be noted that, since fears and phobias can lead to ill health, those who urge policies based on fear and not scientific facts could be making a medical problem out of a social one. This is indeed a strange prospect to see coming from the efforts of members of the medical profession.\"\n\nWe are not ignoring the fact that cigarette smoke can be bothersome to many non-smokers. But we believe this problem is best solved not by governments but by individuals, and not with more rhetoric but more common sense and courtesy. Of course, if anti-smoking advocates want to work for the abolition of smoking, that is their right. We only wish they would come out from behind their second-hand smokescreen.\n\nR.J.

I strongly believe that a country's economic capacity is significantly enriched when its institutions build and own internationally competitive brands. Winning brands serve as market anchors to support the competitiveness of the entire value chains of which they are a part. Strong domestic brands create much larger value since they create, capture and retain value within the country. Your Company takes justifiable pride in creating world-class Indian brands that have demonstrated immense vitality in the global Indian market place.

Pyrethrum, rotenone, and nicotine are destroyed relatively rapidly after application, but compounds incorporating copper, lead, and arsenic are persistent.\n\nThe distribution and persistence of other chlorinated hydrocarbons have been studied in less detail, although some of these chemicals have been widely applied. One of these, dieldrin, resembles DDT in stability, persistence, and in solubility. Recently, it has been found in the fat of residents of southern England. It has also been found in many wild birds, fish, and mammals in the United States. These facts led the Panel to anticipate that surveys will discover dieldrin and other persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons in man and wildlife throughout most of the United States.\n\n7", "xqgl0226_p9.jpg": "ESTIMATED ANNUAL REVENUE BASED ON VARYING PERCENTAGES OF EACH GROUP PARTICIPATING IN THE SUGAR RESEARCH FOUNDATION, INC.\n\n% OF GROUP ASSESSMENT % OF GROUP ASSESSMENT\n\nBeet Processors 55% $ 63,767.54 75% $114,228.46  \nOffshores 40% 21,223.55 60% 31,835.31  \nU.S. Cane Refiners 85% 213,761.83 90% 226,336.05  \n\nRaw Sugar Producers:  \nCuba 40% 23,634.34 60% 35,451.50  \nPuerto Rico 60% 18,091.93 80% 24,122.57  \nHawaii 100% 33,776.26 100% 33,776.26  \n\n$394,255.45 $465,750.15  \n\nBased on .5%, .3% and .2% scale of assessment", "pqhw0004_p2.jpg": "ISLANDWIDE STORE AUDIT (PROJECT W.I.T.)  \nMRPPR04/95  \nIV.

Although no Jules Vernes were available, compromises were worked out.\n\nThe brochure, a blue-and-white folder listing topics offered, was sent last fall to a program of a chairman of women\u2019s clubs, church groups, PTAs and other service groups in the St. Louis area.\n\nRegularly revised, the new booklet lists topics suggested by faculty members. No names are given. \u201cThis way,\u201d points out Miss Eileen Wolff, director of the bureau, \u201cthe faculty members aren\u2019t bothered by calls from organizations. It saves time and trouble for both professor and organization if arrangements can be made through the bureau.\u201d\n\nSome faculty members, long known in the community as good speakers, are still approached directly by many groups. But the campus office strives steadily to inform these organizations that it will serve as \u201cmiddleman\u201d and take care of time-consuming details.\n\nThe Speakers Bureau, part of the program of the Office of Information since 1956, grew out of an informal tradition of the University. Names of available speakers had been kept in a file inherited in 1953 by University College. Callers were given names of professors willing to speak on desired subjects. University College completed arrangements for the talks.\n\nOrganization of the Speakers Bureau on its present basis is a product of the University\u2019s Second Century Development Program. In its first year of operation, the bureau drew on a wide variety of speakers. Talks given covered such diverse matters as college football, D. H. Lawrence\u2019s poetry, community ideals, China and the Far East, children\u2019s behavioral problems and WU excavations in Greece.\n\nA Panel of Americans, the only student speakers scheduled by the bureau, appeared before several organizations last fall. Active on campus since 1948, this panel is part of a national project designed to promote inter-faith and interracial understanding.\n\nOrganizations needing speakers must make the overtures. For its part, the bureau stands ready to expand its work in an effort to strengthen ties between community and University. N.M.B.\n\nWASHINGTON UNIVERSITY ST.

Beltline racks, universal merchandisers and express checklane displays (in conjunction with another industry fixture) will generally yield higher RJR sales and share than centralized spinners or gondola end frames.\n\nResearch Results\nThree major package merchandising tests involving various pack fixtures and locations in supermarkets have been completed. The objective of each test was to identify the method that yielded the highest RJR share and total category pack sales. Attempts were made to measure pack shrink in two of the tests, but results were unreliable.\n\nUPM's Versus CPM's\nTest objective was to determine the financial value to RJR of having RJR package fixtures in a major chain versus Philip Morris' package fixtures. RJR centralized and universal package fixtures were tested against Philip Morris centralized fixtures. RJR's universal fixtures included flighted pack promotion using promotional toppers of the fixtures. RJR load plans placed RJR brands in the top section of each fixture, while RJR brands were located at the bottom of the Philip Morris fixture. Two centralized fixtures were used in each store and located near the first and last checkouts. Two universal fixtures were used in each store, located at an express checkout and a frequently used regular checkout.\n\nResults\nRJR centralized versus PM centralized:\nRJR's share of pack sales was a significant 3.9 share points higher with the RJR fixtures.\nThere was no significant change in total category pack volume.\nThere was no difference in RJR share of total cigarette sales (packs and cartons) when either the RJR or PM spinner was used.", "yyhd0227_p50.jpg": "TABLE I  \nTEST-RETEST AND INTEROBSERVER RELIABILITY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST MEASURES  \n\nVARIABLE  \nBrazelton Neonatal Assessment  \nBG 1 .67 20 .97 20  \n\nComposite Infant Scale  \n6 months mental .88 20 .82 15  \n6 months motor .92 20 .82 15  \n15 months mental .88 20 .87 15  \n15 months motor .87 20 .87 15  \n24 months mental .86 20 .85 15  \n24 months motor .44 20 .85 15  \n\nPreschool Battery (36 months)  \nCognitive Composite .87 40 -b -  \nEmbedded Figures Test Sum .81 20 .99 140  \nEmbedded Figures Test Time .63 20 .99 140  \nEmbedded Figures Test Adaptability .63 20 -b -  \nDigit Span .65 20 .99 140  \nSentence Span .60 20 .99 140  \nReversal Discrimination Learning Sum .60 40 -b -  \nReversal Discrimination Learning Time .40 20 N.A. -  \nNaming .86 20 1.00 140  \nRecoanition .91 20 .99 140  \nVerbal Inferences .62 20 N.A. -  \nLine Velocity .65 20 .99 140  \nRompecabezas .45 20 .97 140  \n\na Not available.  \nb Not appropriate; score is constructed, not observed.  \nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/yyhd0227", "jjfb0228_p0.jpg": "Form HEW-1  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE  \n1.

They have fun, live for today, and definitely believe in the motto \"pleasure before duty.\"  \n\nOf all the groups, Play-Boys possess the highest degree of self-esteem. While they don't have a lot of money (yet), they place a great amount of emphasis on its importance. Play-Boys are into material possessions and are proud to it: As for working, a job/career is definitely a means to an end for these guys - preferably, a weekend.  \n\nPlay-Boys like to think of themselves as active and adventurous. They want more excitement and sensation out of life, and like to imagine themselves doing things others wouldn't dare do (like bungee jumping). Their vacations are on the active \"field and stream\" side and their activities tend to be of a more strenuous nature (hiking, camping, skiing).  \n\nWhile they don't like to shop, they certainly have a lot of stuff, and they like to be the first to try new things (regardless of price).

A Public Health Nutritionist who had worked on development and execution of a supermarket project in Washington funded by the Regional Medical Program met with us. I think we benefited a great deal from the experiences of that group. In that particular program, dietitians were stationed in the store to answer questions from the shoppers. They felt the response to this was good. However, their chance to evaluate it was unsuccessful. They handed a questionnaire to shoppers requesting them to return it completed within a desired period of time. Consequently, few were returned. They also prepared and distributed literature containing shopping hints for a fat-controlled diet. The store personnel prepared posters on the benefits of certain food items and hung them in strategic places in the store. Labels designating recommended low saturated fat and acceptable low saturated fat products were placed under the appropriate grouping of such foods. In this case, the store was constantly changing the location of foods, thus making the labels meaningless.  \n\nAfter exploring several ideas of things that could be done in a supermarket setting and still avoiding the endorsement problem, we felt that one of the most effective things we could do would be to prepare a packet of materials to be sent to many of the large grocery chains for their use in various ways. The packet would consist of materials such as the following:  \n\n1. The Way to a Man's Heart  \n2. The Recipe Booklet  \n3.

Resource Person - Dorothy Throssell, B.S. Panel Members: Mrs. Dorothy Koester, a parent representing the P.T.A. Mrs. Gretchen Claus, Executive Secretary of the Ottawa County Tuberculosis and Health Association Mr. Earl Johnson - supervisor grades 5 through 12, Ottawa County Schools Ottawa County reported an effective program of nutrition education. Motivation and cooperation are essentials to success and a step-by-step description was given as to how this had been achieved. A school health council consisting of a doctor, a dentist, nurses, parents, teachers, school administrators, and others was organized with two stated objectives: 1) To study and plan school health programs 2) Promote health services in schools After the school health council was organized, a dental survey and dietary study was made of all the sixth-grade children in the county. While the survey was going on, a unit on good nutrition and dental health was taught in the schools. Newspapers cooperated to acquaint the community with the survey. Some actions initiated by the results of the survey: 1) School lunch participation was encouraged 2) Compulsion in the lunchroom was discouraged. More effort was made toward making mealtime pleasant 3) Candy, soda pop, and potato chip machines were eliminated 4) Teachers encouraged children to remain in the lunchroom to eat 5) Children were encouraged to eat small portions of unfamiliar foods 6) Parents were helped to set good examples 7) Food was emphasized in relation to youngsters' interests: beauty and physical fitness. The enthusiasm spread to homes and studies for teenagers were also initiated. Community response continued and the council was thrilled with the apparent results and the implications for still greater participation. \n\nTrends In Nutrition Education Ruth Leverton, Ph.D. Assistant Director Human Nutrition Research Division Institute of Home Economics U.S. Department of Agriculture These two days have furnished excellent opportunity for us as nutritionists to ask \"Where are we now - and where do we go from here?\" There are many right ways to teach nutrition and to attain good nutritional status. We must avoid attempts to impose our own eating patterns on others. Some examples of our misjudgments are: 1) Trying to give liquid milk to countries unaccustomed to \"drinking\" their food. 2) Deploring a breakfast of fried potatoes, sausage, and sausage versus one cup of cocoa and a sweet roll. 3) Over-emphasizing \"togetherness\" versus \"independence\". 4) Considering that a soft cooked egg is better for breakfast than a baked custard. 5) Forgetting that citrus fruit can be just as valuable for lunch as for breakfast. \n\nObjectives Good food habits should be \"built in\" so they will be followed automatically. We also need to develop judgment so we can adjust our habits and make good choices when the need arises. \n\nOur Strengths One of our strengths is the appreciation of the fact that many people do have good food habits and eat well. Research statistics should be presented with a positive approach. Emphasizing many are getting proper foods may be more effective than emphasizing those who are not, because it stimulates the others to want to join the approved group. A second strength is our spirit of adventure. Our objectives stay flexible and we are willing to try new methods and new techniques without fear of failure. The third strength lies in the", "nxyc0227_p22.jpg": "It is noted that the Department of Nutrition of the University of Valle, in conjunction with the Harvard School of Public Health, is presently studying the development of food protein supplements from locally grown vegetable products.\n\nThe essential functions of such a food research institute and needs of a food laboratory are listed in Appendix IV. This list should be considered minimal. Other equipment should be found necessary as research programs develop.\n\n10. A School of Home Economics should be established, possibly within the National University, to provide graduates for youth work, school programs and home demonstration projects in conjunction with the program in nutrition education.\n\n11. Training of agricultural scientists should be encouraged and expanded.\n\n12. Better coordination of existing agricultural development programs, official and beneficial, should be established.\n\n13. Attention should be given to strengthening public confidence in quality control and enforcement programs for feeds, fertilizers and agricultural chemicals by vigorous administration of present policies and extension of these policies where needed to assure provision of reliable sources of agricultural supplies.\n\n14. The food processing industry should be strengthened by:\n\na. The development of quality grading systems for raw products as a basis for purchases and payment. Such standards create an incentive for production of high quality by producers.\n\nb. Establishment of effective Government regulations for purity of processed foods. Safe, wholesome food is important for the health of the people as well as for the protection of reputable producers.\n\nDevelopment of a can manufacturing industry, which would relieve the food processors of such problems as obtaining tin plate, fabricating and enameling cans, obtaining proper closures, etc.\n\nd. The construction of additional processing and storage facilities near the source of raw material supplies. For example, the establishment of meat processing plants in areas of cattle production would eliminate great losses in quantity and quality of meat incurred during transportation to market. Investment in facilities for such catching, freezing and canning of fish should be made in order to take advantage of the abundant supply of this great food resource in Colombia.\n\nIn March of 1961 the American Can Company announced its plans to establish a factory for the production of cans in Barranquilla.", "ztvg0227_p0.jpg": "March 30, 1976\n\nDear Staff Member:\n\nThe fading first quarter of 1976 is leaving in its wake another active period for St. Louis home health services.

As a result of his visit and what he learned from it, other board members have asked me to arrange similar trips.\n\nThose who attended the March 14 Zonta/VNA Scholarship concert reported having a delightful time. The program featured David Hartman of ABC-TV and Julius Hunter of KMOX-TV. As you will recall, this is the second year that the St. Louis County Zonta Club has co-sponsored a symphony project for our benefit. This year, proceeds will be used for scholarship support of Sheryl Cross, who will become our second staff pediatric nurse practitioner.\n\nIn April, the Zonta will discuss the possibility of having a \"Night\" at one of the summer Queeny Park St. Louis Symphony pop concert events that may attract even more people than Sunday afternoon Powell Hall concerts.", "fxxh0227_p38.jpg": "1944  1948  Difference (1948-1944)  \nPrevalence of Lesions (per cent)  \nMild Follicular Changes in Skin  37.7  21.5  -16.2  \nThickening of Conjunctivae  76.6  57.5  -19.1  \nSerum Vitamin A (Microgm. per 100 ml.)  22  41  +19 \u00b1 1.3  ", "msgj0223_p98.jpg": "16 The Computation of Earnings per Share:\n\nCURRENT YEAR Rupees PREVIOUS YEAR Rupees\n\n(a) Numerator: Net Profit/Loss as per Profit and Loss Account (after tax) (33,88,33,475) (11,33,66,330)  \n(b) Denominator: Number of weighted average Equity Shares outstanding For Basic & diluted Earning per share 1,75,88,021 1,75,88,021  \n(c) Earnings per Equity Share Basic and diluted (19.27) (6.45)  \n(d) Nominal value per Equity Share Rs.10 Rs.10  \n\n17 Disclosure in respect of Operating Leases:\n\nAssets taken on lease:  \n(a) The Company has taken various residential / commercial premises under cancelable Operating Leases.

In 2011-12, the total energy consumed by ITC stands at 21,130 TJ which is 5.3% lower than the energy utilised during the previous year (22,554 TJ in 2010-11), inspite of significant growth in production volumes in almost all businesses.\n\nThe largest integrated Paperboards and Paper Unit at Bhadrachalam which accounted for 71% of the total energy consumed across ITC in 2011-12 has achieved a significant reduction of 12% in energy consumed per tonne of product over the last year, which now stands at 33.21 GJ per tonne of product.\n\nIn addition to the 43.6 MW wind power projects and a 90 TPH biomass fired Boiler already in operation for over a year, it has installed additional 13.3 MW wind energy units in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. These investments and better utilisation of biomass in the Paperboards and Specialty Papers Business ensured that 38.5% of the Company's total energy requirements are from renewable sources, which is a remarkable achievement.\n\nIncrease in large scale carbon sequestration: Total CO2 emissions from ITC's operations decreased to 1,564 Kilotonnes in 2011-12 from 2,046 Kilotonnes in 2010-11. These emissions, estimated in accordance with the GRI-G3 reporting framework, include 1,157 Kilotonnes of CO2 emissions arising from use of direct energy (scope 1), 160 Kilotonnes from purchased electricity (scope 2) and 247 Kilotonnes emitted due to transportation of materials and products (scope 3).\n\nITC continues to be a Carbon Positive Corporation for 7 consecutive years.\n\nCO2 Emissions and Sequestration\n2009-10 2010-11 2011-12\n4785 4011 4380\n1709 2046 1564\n\nSource: https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/rnbx0223", "gmhn0020_p0.jpg": "RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company\n\nI.

ITC secured a 5 Star GRIHA rating, the highest national rating for green buildings in India, for the ITC Grand Chola, the 600-key super-premium luxury hotel complex in Chennai, which is also the world's largest LEED Platinum certified green hotel under the 'New Construction' category. The Company incorporates validated green attributes while setting up new infrastructure and efforts are underway to have existing buildings and factories meet these validated green norms. The Company has also pioneered Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulp & paper/paperboards in India, with the implementation of 'Ozone bleaching' technology, a first in the country.\n\nThe Company continues to invest in reducing air emission levels through adoption of cleaner technologies/fuels, monitoring of combustion efficiencies and investment in state-of-the-art pollution control equipment, such as plasma filters and electrostatic precipitators etc. ITC units monitor significant air emission parameters, such as Particulate Matter (PM), Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) to ensure compliance with internal norms that are more stringent than regulatory requirements.\n\nImplementation of Environmental Management Systems\n\nIn pursuit of its EHS Policy commitments, the Company has established Environmental Health and Safety Management systems certified by accredited agencies in line with International Standards like ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.
